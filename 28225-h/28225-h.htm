<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> monographs by contemporary scholars on the
inexhaustible theme of Book-Collecting have made their
appearance during the last twenty years. All such undertakings
have more or less their independent value and
merit from the fact that each is apt to reflect and preserve
the special experiences and predilections of the
immediate author; and so it happens in the present case.
A succession of Essays on the same subject is bound to
traverse the same ground, yet no two of them, perhaps,
work from the same seeing point, and there may be
beyond the topic substantially little in common between
them and the rest of the literature, which has steadily
accumulated round this attractive and fruitful subject for
bookman and artist.</p>

<p>During a very long course of years I have had occasion
to study books in all their branches, in almost all
tongues, of almost all periods, personally and closely.
No early English volumes, while I have been on the
track, have, if I could help it, escaped my scrutiny;
and I have not let them pass from my hands without
noting every particular which seemed to me important
and interesting in a historical, literary, biographical, and
bibliographical respect. The result of these protracted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a>[<a href="./images/vi.png">vi</a>]</span>
and laborious investigations is partly manifest in my
<i>Bibliographical Collections</i>, 1867-1903, extending to eight
octavo volumes; but a good deal of matter remained,
which could not be utilised in that series or in my other
miscellaneous contributions to <i>belles lettres</i>.</p>

<p>So it happened that I found myself the possessor of
a considerable body of information, covering the entire
field of Book-Collecting in Great Britain and Ireland
and on the European continent, and incidentally illustrating
such cognate features as Printing Materials,
Binding, and Inscriptions or Autographs, some enhancing
the interest of an already interesting item, others
conferring on an otherwise valueless one a peculiar
claim to notice.</p>

<p>My collections insensibly assumed the proportions of
the volume now submitted to the public; and in the
process of seeing the sheets through the press certain
supplementary Notes suggested themselves, and form
an Appendix. It has been my endeavour to render
the Index as complete a clue as possible to the whole
of the matter within the covers.</p>

<p>As my thoughts carry me back to the time&mdash;it is
fifty years&mdash;when I commenced my inquiries into literary
antiquities, I see that I have lived to witness a new
Hegira: New Ideas, New Tastes, New Authors. The
American Market and the Shakespear movement<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a>[<a href="./images/vii.png">vii</a>]</span>
turned everything and everybody upside down. But
Time will prove the friend of some of us.</p>

<p>In the following pages I have avoided the repetition
of particulars to be found in my <i>Four Generations of
a Literary Family</i>, 1897, and in my <i>Confessions of a
Collector</i>, 1897, so far as they concern the immediate
subject-matter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">A Manual</span> for the more immediate and especial use of
English-speaking inquirers is bound to limit itself, in
the first place, mainly to the literary products of the
three kingdoms and the colonies; and, secondly, to a
broad and general indication of the various paths which
it is open to any one to pursue according to his tastes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[<a href="./images/2.png">2</a>]</span>
or possibilities, with clues to the best sources of intelligence
and guidance. The English collector, where
he crosses the border, as it were, and admits works of
foreign origin into his bookcase, does not often do so
on a large scale; but he may be naturally tempted to
make exceptions in favour of certain <i>chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</i> irrespective
of nationality. There are books and tracts
which commend themselves by their typographical importance,
by their direct bearing on maritime discovery,
by their momentous relation to the fine arts, or by their
link with some great personality. These stand out in
relief from the normal category of foreign literature;
they speak a language which should be intelligible to all.</p>

<p>It must be obvious that in a restricted space a
writer has no scope for anecdote and gossip, if they
are not actually out of place in a technical undertaking.
Yet we have endeavoured to lay before our readers, in
as legible a form as possible, a view of the subject and
counsel as to the various methods and lines of Collecting.</p>

<p>Such an enterprise as we offer, in the face of several
which have already appeared under various titles and
auspices, may at first sight seem redundant; but perhaps
it is not really the case. A book of this class is,
as a rule, written by a scholar for scholars; that is all
very well, and very charming the result is capable of
proving. Or, again, the book is addressed by a bibliographer
to bibliographers; and here there may be, with
a vast deal that is highly instructive, a tendency to bare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[<a href="./images/3.png">3</a>]</span>
<i>technique</i>, which does not commend itself to many outside
the professional or special lines. It was thought,
under these circumstances, that a new volume, combining
readability and a fair proportion of general interest with
practical information and advice, was entitled to favourable
consideration; and the peculiar training of the
present writer during his whole life, at once as a <i>litterateur</i>
and a practical bookman, encouraged the idea on his
part that it might well be feasible for him to carry the
plan into execution, and produce a view of a permanently
interesting and important subject in all its branches and
aspects, appealing not only to actual book-collectors,
but to those who may naturally desire to learn to what
the science and pursuit amount.</p>

<p>One of the best apologies for book-collecting, and
even for the accumulation of fine books, is that offered
by McCulloch in the preface to his own catalogue. The
writer takes occasion to observe, among other points
and arguments: "It is no doubt very easy to ridicule
the taste for fine books and their accumulation in extensive
libraries. But it is not more easy than to ridicule
the taste for whatever is most desirable, as superior
clothes, houses, furniture, and accommodation of every
sort. A taste for improved or fine books is one of the
least equivocal marks of the progress of civilisation,
and it is as much to be preferred to a taste for those
that are coarse and ill got up, as a taste for the pictures
of Reynolds or Turner is to be preferred to a taste for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="./images/4.png">4</a>]</span>
the daubs that satisfy the vulgar. A man acts foolishly,
if he spend more money on books or anything else
than he can afford; but the folly will be increased, not
diminished, by his spending it on mean and common
rather than on fine and uncommon works. The latter
when sold invariably bring a good price, more perhaps
than was paid for them, whereas the former either bring
nothing or next to nothing."</p>

<p>McCulloch's maternal grandfather was possibly the
book-lover from whom the eminent political economist
inherited his taste.</p>

<p>In common with the Manuscript Document and the
Autograph Letter, the Written Book forms such a vast
department of inquiry and study, that it would be undesirable,
and indeed almost impracticable, in a volume
of limited extent on book-collecting, to include the consideration
of any collateral subject.</p>

<p>The broad facts regarding our national collections
of MSS. are sufficiently well known, no less than the
principal repositories in which they are to be found
and consulted, and the individuals who have signalised
themselves from time to time as owners of this class
of property on various scales or on various principles.
Nearly everybody with any claim to culture is familiar
with the names of Cotton, Arundel, Harley, Lansdowne,
Birch, Burney, Egerton, Hardwicke, and Stowe, in connection
with precious assemblages of monuments in
the National Library; Parker, Tanner, Fairfax, Ash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>mole
and others at Oxford or Cambridge; Carew at
Lambeth, and a succession of private enthusiasts in this
direction, either independently or in conjunction with
the printed side&mdash;Dering of Surrenden, Le Neve, Martin
of Palgrave, Duke of Buckingham, Sir Thomas Phillipps,
Libri, Lord Ashburnham, Heber, and Bright.</p>

<p>In the case of MSS. it is equally true with printed
literature that the interest and value depend on circumstances,
and are liable to changes and vicissitudes.
They may be classified into countries, periods, and subjects,
and their appreciation depends on their character
even more than on their mere rarity. An unique MS.
may possibly be quite worthless. A comparatively common
one may command a good price. How numerous
soever the ancient copies of Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>
might be, another coming into the open market would still
be an object of keen competition; and where importance
is coupled with scarcity or uniqueness, of course the latter
feature lends a high additional weight to the matter, and
multiplies inquirers.</p>

<p>We must, however, in justice to this branch of the
topic and to our readers, refrain from further pursuit
of the discussion of it, as its adequate treatment would
absorb a monograph to the full extent as ample as the
present, and such a Manual is in point of fact a desideratum&mdash;one,
too, which the improved state of bibliographical
knowledge would assist in rendering much
more satisfactory than was formerly possible.</p>

The <i>Rolls of Collectors</i> by the present writer afford
a convenient view of the different classes of society in
the now United Kingdom, which from the outset to
the present day have created, during unequal periods of
duration, more or less noteworthy centres of literary
or bibliographical gatherings, from the Harley, Roxburghe,
Heber, or Huth level to that of the owner&mdash;often
not less to be admired or commended&mdash;of the humble
shelf-ful of volumes. Here names occur associated with
the most widely varied aims in respect to scope and
compass, yet all in a certain measure participating in
the credit of admitting to their homes products of intellectual
industry and ingenuity beyond such matter
as Family Bibles, Directories, Railway Guides, Charles
Lamb's <i>Biblia-a-Biblia</i>, and sixpenny or threepenny editions
of popular authors, which constitute the staple
decorations of the average British middle-class household
in this nonagenarian nineteenth century.</p>

<p>So early as the time of the later Stuarts, a movement
seems to have commenced both in England and Scotland,
not only in the chief centres, but in provincial towns, for
the education of the middle class, and even of the higher
grade of agriculturists, who sent their children to schools,
and at the same time, in the absence of circulating
libraries, improved their own minds by the exchange of
books, as we perceive in contemporary diaries and correspondence;
and Macaulay doubtless overcolours the ignorance
and debasement of the bulk of society about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>
period of the Revolution of 1688, apparently in order to
maintain a cue with which he had started. The Diary
of John Richards, a farmer at Warmwell in Dorsetshire,
1697-1702, is an unimpeachable witness on the other
side; it is printed in the <i>Retrospective Review</i>, 1853.</p>

<p>It was about the same date that we find even in
Scotland a project for establishing throughout the country,
in every parish, Reference or Lending Libraries,
and some pamphlets on the subject have come down to
us; but we hear nothing more about it. This was in
1699-1702, just when the indefatigable John Dunton was
sending from the press his multifarious periodical news-books
for the benefit of the more literary sort in South
Britain.</p>

<p>The Circulating Library in the United Kingdom in
its inception was intended more particularly for the better-to-do
class, and even to-day its tariff is hardly compatible
with very narrow resources. Perhaps the earliest effort
to bring literature within the reach of the working-man
was Charles Knight's scheme of "Book-Clubs for all
Readers," mentioned in a letter to him of 1844 from
Dickens.</p>

<p>A remarkable change in the fortunes and tactics of
the collector has arisen from one in our social institutions.
The book-hunter of times past, if he was a resident in
the provinces, and worked on a more or less systematic
and ambitious scale&mdash;nay, if he merely picked up articles
from year to year which struck his fancy, relied, as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>
was able to do, on his country town. Thither gravitated,
as a rule, the products of public and private sales from
the surrounding neighbourhood within a fairly wide
radius. If a library was placed in the market, the sale
took place on the premises or at the nearest centre; there
was no thought of sending anything short of a known
collection up to London. The transit in the absence of
railways was too inconvenient and costly. These conditions,
which long survived better possibilities, naturally made
certain headquarters throughout the kingdom a perfect
Eldorado and Elysium, first of all for local enthusiasts
miles round, and later on for metropolitan bargain-seekers,
who made periodical tours in certain localities
at present as barren as Arabia Petr&aelig;a.</p>

<p>The principal points appear, so far as existing information
goes, to have been in the North: Newcastle,
York, Sheffield, Leeds; in the Midlands: Birmingham and
Manchester; in the West: Plymouth, Exeter, and Bristol;
in the South: Chichester; in the East: Norwich, Yarmouth,
Colchester, Bury, and Ipswich. It was at Chichester that
the poet Collins brought together a certain number of
early books, some of the first rarity; his name is found,
too, in the sale catalogues of the last century as a buyer
of such; and the strange and regrettable fact is, that two
or three items, which Thomas Warton actually saw in his
hands, and of which there are no known duplicates, have
not so far been recovered.</p>

<p>East Anglia during a prolonged period was peculiarly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[<a href="./images/9.png">9</a>]</span>
rich in holders and seekers of the Old Book, both manuscript
and printed. It formerly abounded in monastic
institutions, affluent county families, and literary arch&aelig;ologists.
We may mention Lord Petre, the Hanmers of
Mildenhall, the Herveys of Ickworth, the Bunburys of
Bury, the Tollemaches, the Freres, the Fountaines, Sir
John Fenn, Martin of Palgrave, Dawson Turner, and the
Rev. John Mitford. It was the same, as we take elsewhere
occasion to show, in the West of England, in the
Midlands, in the Northern counties, and in the South of
Scotland. The absence of ready communication with the
metropolis and the relative insignificance of provincial
centres kept libraries together. Their owners, while the
agricultural interest was flourishing, had no motive for
sale, and the inducement to part with such property
was far less powerful, while the competition remained
limited.</p>

<p>In Kent: Canterbury and Maidstone; in Surrey:
Guildford, Croydon, Kingston, and even Richmond, may
have helped to supply local requirements to a certain
extent. But the Sydneys of Penshurst, the Oxindens
of Barham, the Lee-Warlys, the Barretts of Lee, the
Evelyns of Sayes-Court and Wootton, and others among
the gentry of these and the adjacent shires, probably
filled their shelves in principal measure from the London
shops during their periodical visits to the metropolis for
various purposes.</p>

<p>Even in later times the suburbs of London, and now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
and then such localities as Woolwich, Reading, Manchester,
Shrewsbury, Salisbury, Wrexham, Conway, Keswick,
and Dublin have yielded a prize or so, owing to
the dispersion of some small library in the neighbourhood
on the premises. Otherwise one may prospect the country
towns all over the three kingdoms nowadays, and not see
anything save new stock and penny-box ware. Even the
provincial centres are, in general, sterile enough; but the
rural districts are dried up. Every species of property
seems to drift to London.</p>

<p>The Bristol houses, Kerslake, Jefferies, George, Lasbury,
often came across rarities; but it is so no longer.
The West has been threaded through. If there is a
section of England where some good things may yet
linger, it is, we should say, in Staffordshire, Lancashire,
and Shropshire, to which might perhaps be added
Worcestershire.</p>

<p>The seats of our two ancient Universities, and cathedral
cities generally, have not yielded such ample fruit
to the explorer, perhaps because there has always been
a species of magnetic attraction, by which any spoils of
the kind are drawn into the local libraries and museums.
A graduate of Oxford or Cambridge, a canon of this
or that church, a loyal dweller in Winchester or Lincoln,
possesses or discovers a rare volume, and his impulse,
if he does not keep it himself, is to bestow it on his
place of residence or education. Whatever happens,
the stranger coming to hunt in these preserves arrives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>
only in time to learn that the stall or the shop has
given up some unique desideratum a day or two before,
and is referred to the librarian of the college, or to
the buyer at such an address, if he desires to inspect
it, which, if his aims are simply commercial, be sure
he does not. The aggravation is already sufficient!</p>

<p>At the same time, the Universities and Inns of
Court have been from time to time the homes of many
famous book-collections. Robert Burton, Anthony
Wood, John Selden, Sir David Dundas, Mr. Dyce,
Dr. Bliss, Dr. Bandinel, Dr. Coxe, Mr. Bradshaw, are
only a few select names.</p>

<p>In the same way there was a time, and not so distant,
when Edinburgh, and even Dublin, yielded their
proportion of finds, and the Duke of Roxburghe and
General Swinton, David Laing and James Maidment,
obtained no insignificant share of their extremely curious
and valuable stores from their own ground. Now the
Scotish amateur and bookseller equally look to the
great metropolis for the supply of their wants, and
the North Country libraries are sent up to London
for sale. The capital of Scotland has lost its ancient
prestige as a cover for this sort of sport, and is as
unproductive as an ordinary English provincial town.</p>

<p>From an acquisitive standpoint the locality signifies
no longer. The game is up. The three kingdoms have
been well-nigh ransacked and exhausted. The country
town is as bare as a bird's tail of anything but common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>-place
stuff, bought in the London market, and (if any
dweller in a distant city is simple enough to order it
from the unsophisticated vendor) charged with a good
profit and the freight up. Naturally the provincial
dealer, if he stumbles on a gem or two in an accidental
way, takes care that it is sold in no corner, unless it be
at the corner of Wellington Street in the Strand. He
considers that the value may be a matter of doubt, and
he leaves it to gentlemen to decide between them how
much it is worth. Do you blame him?</p>

<p>It is a frequently debated point whether at home in
Great Britain the feeling for books, in the collector's
sense, is not on the decline; and, indeed, the causes of
such a change are not far to seek. The acute pressure
of business among the wealthy mercantile class, which
principally contributes to the ranks of book-buyers, and
the decrease of resources for such luxuries among the
nobility and clergy, might be sufficient to explain a
shrinkage in the demand for the older and rarer literature
in our own and other languages; but there is
another and even more powerful agency at work which
operates in the same direction, and is adverse to the
investment of money in objects which do not appeal
directly to the eye. The <i>bibliophile</i> discovers, when he
has expended a small fortune (or perhaps a large one)
in the formation of a library, that his friends evince
no interest in it, have no desire to enter the room
where the cases are kept, do not understand what they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>
are told about this or that precious acquisition, and
turn on their heel to look at the pictures, the antique
furniture, or the china. This undoubtedly wide-spread
sentiment strikes a very serious blow at a pursuit in
which the enthusiast meets with slight sympathy or
encouragement, unless it is at the hands of the dealers,
naturally bound for their own sakes to keep him in
heart by sympathy and flattery. Doubtless the present
aspect of the question might have become ere now
more serious, had it not been for the American market
and the extension of the system of public and free
libraries.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, while enormous numbers of
books are sold under the hammer year by year, there
must be an approximately proportionate demand and
an inexhaustible market, or the book trade could not
keep pace with the auctioneers; and, moreover, we may
be in a transitional state in some respects, and may be
succeeded by those whose appetite for the older literature
will be keener than it ever was.</p>

<p>The complaint of a superabundance of books of all
kinds is not a new one. It goes back at least to the
reign of Elizabeth and the age of Shakespeare, for in 1594,
in a sermon preached at Paul's Cross, a divine says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is no ende of making Bookes, and much reading
is a wearinesse to the flesh, and in our carelesse daies bookes
may rather seeme to want readers, than readers to want
bookes."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
No one should be too positive whether it is to the
rich or to the poor book-collector that the romantic
element chiefly or more powerfully attaches itself. It
has been our lot to enjoy the acquaintance of both
classes, and we hesitate to pronounce any decided opinion.
There is the unquestionable triumph of the man with a
full purse or an inexhaustible banking account, who has
merely to resolve upon a purchase or a series of purchases,
and to write a cheque for the sum total. He is no sooner
recognised by the members of the trade as a zealous
enthusiast and a liberal paymaster, than offers arrive, and
continue to arrive, from all sides. He is not asked to
take any trouble; his library is an object of solicitude to
everybody who has anything to sell; the order on his
bankers is all that his humble servants desire. He finds
himself, after the lapse of a decade or so, the master of a
splendid collection, without having once known what it
was to get disagreeably warm or anxious in the pursuit
of a volume, to deliberate whether he could afford to buy
it, or to submit to the ordeal of attending an auction, one
of a motley throng in a fetid atmosphere. All these trials
he has been spared; he has collected with kid gloves.</p>

<p>On the contrary, a good deal may be said in favour
of the amateur of moderate fortune, who by personal
judgment slowly accumulates an important and enviable
assemblage of literary monuments, like the Rev. Thomas
Corser, who spent &pound;9000 during a lifetime on books,
which realised &pound;20,000, and would now bring thrice as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>
much, and perhaps even more; and in that of men such
as Charles Lamb and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who had
to pause before they laid out a few shillings in this
way. The history of Lamb's books is more humanly
interesting than the history of the Huth or Grenville
library; as chattels or furniture they were worthless;
they were generally the poorest copies imaginable; but if
they did not cost money, they often cost thought; they
sometimes involved a sacrifice, if the price was in the high
altitude of a sovereign. In the case of Lamb, the sister's
opinion was sought, and the matter lay ever so long in
abeyance before the final decision was taken, and Lamb
hastened to the shop, uncertain if he might not be too
late, if the person whom he saw emerging as he entered
might not have <i>his</i> book in his pocket. Here was payment
in full for the prize; the coin handed to the vendor
was nothing to it; Lamb had laid out more than the
value in many a sleepless night and many an anxious calculation.
Lamb, although he probably never bound a
volume of his own in his life, or purchased one for the
sake of its cover, could grow enthusiastic over his favourite
<i>Duchess of Newcastle</i>, and declare that no casket was
rich enough, no casing sufficiently durable, to honour and
keep safe such a jewel.</p>

<p>Collectors of the abstract type looked, and still look,
at the essence or soul&mdash;at the object pure and simple.
A book is a book for a' that. It may be imperfect,
soiled, wormed, cropped, shabbily bound&mdash;all those things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
belong to its years; let it suffice that there is just enough
of the author to be got in glimpses here and there to
enable the proprietor of him in type to judge his quality
and power. That is what such men as Lamb wanted&mdash;all
they wanted. A copy of Burton's <i>Anatomy</i>, of
Wither's <i>Emblems</i>, or Browne's <i>Urn-Burial</i>, in the best
and newest morocco, was apt to be a hinderance to
their enjoyment of the beauties of the text, was almost
bound to strike them as an intrusion and an impertinence&mdash;perchance
as a sort of sacrilege&mdash;as though
the maker of the cover was seeking to place himself
on a level with the maker of the book. Nor are
there wanting successive renewers of this school of
collector&mdash;of men who have bought books and other
literary property for their own sake, for their intrinsic
worth, irrespectively of rarity and price. A relative
of the writer devoted a long life&mdash;a very long one&mdash;to
the acquisition of what struck him as being curious
and interesting in its way and fell within his resources,
which were never too ample; and in the end he succeeded
in gathering together, without much technical
knowledge of the subject, a fairly large assortment of
volumes, not appealing for the most part to the severer
taste of the more fastidious and wealthier amateur, but
endeared to him at least, as Lamb's were, by the circumstances
under which they came to his hands. Each one
had its <i>historiette</i>. This gentleman represented, as I say,
a type, and a very genuine and laudable one, too. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
admired, almost envied him, not in his possession, but in
his enjoyment of these treasures; they were to him as the
apple of his eye. When I speak of him as a type, I mean
that the same phenomenon still exists. In a letter of
1898 from the extreme North of England there is the
ensuing passage, which strongly impressed my fancy:
"Ever since I had a house of my own&mdash;nearly twenty
years&mdash;I have been a collector of books on a humble
scale. . . . Still, by being continually on the look-out for
'bargains,' I have managed to gather between three and
four thousand volumes together, chiefly of a poetical
nature." Now, to my apprehension, the present aspect
of the matter touches a higher or deeper chord than that
reached by the owner of the most splendid library in the
universe; for all this Heliconian harvest signified personal
search and personal sacrifice.</p>

<p>We do not always bear in mind that the rare books
of to-day were the current literature not merely of, but
long posterior to, the period of their appearance. They
suffered two kinds and stages of deterioration and waste.
While they remained in vogue among readers and
students, they necessarily submitted to a succession of
more or less indifferent owners, who regarded without
much concern objects which it was in their power to
replace without much difficulty. The worst day dawned,
however, for our ancient literature, especially that of a
fugitive or sentimental class, when it had ceased to be
in demand for practical purposes, and was not yet ripe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
for the men, in whose eyes it could only possess arch&aelig;ological
attractions. Independently of destruction by
accidental fires, a century or two of neglect proved fatal
to millions of volumes or other literary records in pamphlet
or broadsheet form; and as tastes changed, the
mill and the fire successively consumed the discarded
favourites of bygone generations, just as at the present
moment we pulp or burn from day to day cartloads of
old science, and theology, and law, and fiction, and ever
so much more, preparing to grow unique.</p>

<p>The Mill has been as busy as the Press all these centuries
on which we look back. It has neither eyes nor
ears, nor has it compassion; it unrelentingly grinds and
consumes all that comes in its way; age after age it has
reduced to dust what the men of the time refuse in the
presence of something newer, and, as they hold, better.
The printers of each generation, from those of Mainz downward,
lent themselves, not unnaturally, not unwisely, to
subjects in the first place (by way of experiment) which
were not costly, and secondly to such as appealed to contemporary
taste and patronage. We find under the
former head Indulgences, Proclamations, Broadsides, Ballads;
under the second, Church Service Books of all
kinds, succeeded after a while by certain of the Classics.
The impressions long remained limited; and continual
use and subsequent neglect accomplished between them
the task of creating the modern bibliographical and
bibliomaniacal schools.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
Even in Anglo-Saxon times the ferocity of warfare
and the ravages of invasion on invasion, coupled with the
scanty diffusion of literary taste, destroyed many of the
monastic libraries. But, which is stranger and less excusable,
even down to the second half of the seventeenth
century, down to Aubrey's day, the greatest havoc continued
to be made in this way alike among printed books
and MSS., the latter being used for all sorts of utilitarian
purposes&mdash;even as bungs for beer-barrels. In our own
period it is immeasurably sadder and more astonishing
to learn that, besides the losses arising from casual conflagrations
to public and private libraries, the old vandalism
is not extinct, and that nothing is sacred in its
eyes, not even the priceless muniments of a cathedral
church.</p>

<p>What must the aggregate have become, if such a process
had not been steadily in operation all these centuries!
And, even as it is, the dispersion of old libraries, like
those of Johnson of Spalding and Skene of Skene, encourages
the waste-paper dealer to believe that the end
is not yet reached. The frequenter of the auction-rooms
of London alone has perpetually under his eyes a mountain
of illegible printed matter sufficient to overload the
shoulders of Atlas.</p>

<p>Bibliomania has as many heads as the famed Briareus;
but it seldom lifts more than two or three at once.
Perhaps it would be impossible to name any variety of
fancy which has not at some time entered into the pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>suit
which we are just now attempting to illustrate.
The love of the book without regard to the binding, or
of the binding irrespectively of the book; the fashion for
works with woodcuts, of certain printers, of certain places,
of certain dates; the establishment of a fixed rule as to a
subject or a group of subjects, taken up collectively or in
succession; a limitation as to price or as to size, for a
candidate for admittance to some cabinets may not exceed
so many inches in altitude; it must go back to the century
which produced it, to be rewritten or reprinted, ere
it may have a place.</p>

<p>It is said of the elder Wertheimer that, when some
one expressed his astonishment at the price which he had
given for an item, and even insinuated his want of wisdom,
he retorted pleasantly that he might be a fool, but
he thought that he knew greater ones than himself.</p>

<p>Do we not under existing conditions view with too
uncharitable sentiments the marvellous good fortune of
the book-hunters of the last century, at the very outset
of a revival of the taste for our own vernacular literature?
Does it not seem tantalising to hear that Warton
the historian could pick up for sixpence a volume containing
<i>Venus and Adonis</i>, 1596, and seven other precious
<i>mor&ccedil;eaux</i>, off a broker's counter in Salisbury, when the
British Museum gave at the Daniel sale &pound;336 for the
Shakespeare alone? What a thrill passes through the
veins, as we read of Rodd the bookseller meeting at a
marine store-shop on Saffron Hill, somewhere about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>
thirties, with a volume of Elizabethan tracts, and having
it weighed out to him at threepence three-farthings!
Our space is far more limited than such anecdotes; but
they all strike us as pointing the same moral. If one
happens on a Caxton or a quarto Shakespeare to-day for
a trifle, it is the isolated ignorance of the possessor which
befriends one. But till the market came for these things,
the price for what very few wanted was naturally low;
and an acquirer like George Steevens, Edward Capell, or
Edmond Malone was scarcely apt to feel the keen gratification
on meeting with some unique find that a man
would now do, seeing that its rarity was yet unascertained,
and even had it been so, was not likely to awaken
much sensation.</p>

<p>Low prices do not alone establish cheapness. Cheap
books are those which are obtained by accident under
the current value. In the time of the later Stuarts,
Narcissus Luttrell found from one penny to sixpence
sufficient to satisfy the shopkeepers with whom he dealt
for some of the most precious volumes in our language;
and a shilling commanded a Caxton. The Huths of those
days could not lay out their money in these things; they
had to take up the ancient typography in the form of the
classics, or large-paper copies of contemporary historians,
or the publications of Hearne.</p>

<p>We do not know that the celebrated Chevalier D'Eon
was singular in his views as a collector in the last century.
He bought in chief measure, if we may judge from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>
document before us, what we should now term nondescripts,
and in the aggregate gave a very handsome
price at a London auction in 1771 for an assemblage
of items at present procurable, if any one wanted them,
at a far lower rate. There is not a lot throughout
which would recommend itself to modern taste, save the
<i>Cuisinier Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, and perhaps that was not in the
old morocco livery considered by judges as <i>de rigueur</i>.
We append the auctioneer's account entire, because it
exhibits a fair example of the class of book which not
only Frenchmen, but ourselves, sought at that time more
than those for which we have long learned to compete,
and which were then offered under the hammer by the
bundle, if not by the basketful. For &pound;8, 4s., a hundred
and twenty-five years ago, how many quarto Shakespears
could one have acquired?</p>

<p>The neglect of our early literature continued, as we
have said, down to the second half of the eighteenth
century. Prior to that time, all the information at
our command tends to show that collectors almost
uniformly restricted themselves to the books current
in or about their own time, as we find even Pepys
asking Bagford to secure for him, not Caxtons or
Elizabethan books, but items which we should now
regard with comparative or absolute indifference. While
some insignificant trifle, which had happened to go out
of print, was sought with avidity, while editions of the
classics and Continental writers, long since converted
to waste paper, were objects of keen rivalry, the most
precious examples of ancient English and Scotish typography
and poetry were obtainable for pence.</p>

<p>A very interesting side to the subject before us is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
the share claimable in it by the fair sex. In our two
<i>Rolls of Book-Collectors</i> we have included the names
of several ladies, who in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, as well as in the earlier part of the present,
established a title to rank among possessors of libraries
in a larger or smaller measure. Two of the most prominent
names are probably those of Miss Richardson Currer,
of Eshton Hall, Yorkshire, and Mrs. Rylands of Manchester,
the latter not only the acquirer of the Althorp
treasures, but of a most valuable body of books, ancient
and modern, in augmentation of them. This feature in
the annals of collecting is the more to be borne in mind,
in that it has in recent days declined almost to disappearance,
and may be said to be limited to a few gentlewomen,
who pursue special studies, like the Hon. Alicia Amherst
and Mrs. Earle, and bring together for use or reference
the works illustrative of them.</p>

<p>A study of the writer's <i>Rolls of Book-Collectors</i>,
which embrace over two thousand names, will satisfy
any one that the hereditary or transmitted collections
in this country are very few, if we limit ourselves to
libraries of note, and do not compensate for the long
catalogue of old libraries which have been dispersed even
in our own time. Are there really more than the Miller
and the Huth, unless we add the Spencer or Althorp,
kept intact and amplified, yet in the hands of a stranger?
Book-collecting by individuals is, then, mainly a personal
affair, which begins and ends with a life. The con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>tinuance
even of the two libraries above mentioned in
private hands cannot be regarded as otherwise than
precarious and terminable; the fourth succession of
Miller has just expired in an unexpected manner, and
the destiny of the Britwell treasures is problematical.
Rumour has long since pointed to the Advocates' Library
at Edinburgh as the ultimate reversioner.</p>

<p>In a volume of moderate compass, professedly addressing
itself in a special manner to English collectors, the
consideration of foreign literature must of necessity be a
secondary and incidental feature and element, although it
may be quite true that our countrymen and countrywomen
look so frequently aside, as it were, from the literary
productions of their own soil to study those of other
lands. In Great Britain we may be said to be much
more cosmopolitan in our book-collecting tastes than
many of our contemporaries on the Continent of Europe,
Germany perhaps excepted. In France, Spain, Portugal,
Italy, and elsewhere, the demand is almost exclusively
for native authors; but the Germans, Americans, and
ourselves take a pride, and a just one, in being more
catholic and broad: we see the advantage, no doubt,
and no doubt we reap the fruit, of such a policy. At
the same time, in a monograph of limited scope it is
obviously impossible to embrace even a general view of
the enormously wide range which is before any one who
crosses over from his own country to add to his English
possessions even a select collection of books in foreign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[<a href="./images/27.png">27</a>]</span>
languages; and we have confined our efforts in this direction
to an indication of such typical or special works
(principally French) as are usually sought by people
in these islands, who resort more or less to the Continental
market. Even prominent Anglo-French amateurs like
Mr. R. S. Turner and Lord Ashburton are found keeping
within certain classes of literature, and certain copies
recommendable by their <i>provenance</i>, binding, or graphic
peculiarities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> hardly falls within the province of a manual for the
book-collector to dwell on the character and relative
merits of the purely public libraries at home and abroad,
or even on the bibliographical possessions of private
personages which are not available for purchase. Recent
experience, however, teaches us that we are not entitled
to count any longer on the intact preservation of the
books of any individual or family, as the sale by auction
has almost become fashionable. At any rate, there can
be no harm in introducing a few remarks on this aspect
and branch of our subject, particularly seeing that the
effect of throwing on the market thousands of rare books,
which were once thought to be hopelessly unattainable,
has contributed to improve the prospects and opportunities
of purchasers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>
The spoliation of public libraries at home and abroad
is an aspect of the question or subject neither very
agreeable nor very flattering. In England and other
parts of the Empire, within the last century, numerous
examples have occurred where valuable or unique books
have been stolen or mutilated. The national collection
in Great Russell Street has perhaps suffered the least,
and whatever may be said about the system on which
it was formerly conducted and managed, sufficient care
seems always to have been exercised to guard against
depredators of various kinds. So far as is publicly
known, petty thefts of articles more or less easily replaceable
are all that we have to regret. It is notorious
that the Bodleian has lost several important volumes,
and no one will probably ever arrive at any definite
information of the extent to which the libraries at Cambridge
and the other minor collections at the sister
Universities of Oxford, Edinburgh, and Dublin have
been pillaged and impoverished.</p>

<p>It has been the same all over the Continent. The
Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at Paris, and many of the leading
provincial libraries of France, have been robbed
wholesale in former times, and in some cases annihilated.
One has only to read the observations and evidence of
M. Achille Jubinal accompanying a (then) inedited
letter of Montaigne (8vo, Paris, 1850), to form an idea
of the ravages which have been made through neglect
of officials and dishonesty of visitors; and what must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
the fact be in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and elsewhere?
The denunciations against robbers of books and
libraries date, however, from the remotest period, and
were at first highly necessary as a means of safeguarding
the treasures of monasteries and churches. Isaac
Taylor, in his <i>History of the Transmission of Ancient
Books to Modern Times</i>, 1875, p. 246, prints an anathema
of this kind: "Whosoever removeth this volume
from this same mentioned convent, may the anger of
the Lord overtake him in this world, and in the next
to all eternity. Amen." Let the energetic explorers
who have transferred so many hundreds of such MSS.
to the Vatican and the British Museum look to it; and
what are His Holiness and the Trustees in Great Russell
Street but palpable accessories after, if not before, the
fact! A common peril hangs over them all.</p>

<p>A visit to a library such as the British Museum or
the Bodleian, or even to those of some of the Colleges
at Oxford and Cambridge, is apt to instil a feeling of
reverential affection for the founders and benefactors
of such institutions; the existing functionaries seem to
withdraw into middle distance, and one enters into communion
with the spirits of the departed.</p>

<p>From the private collector's point of view these great
public libraries are mainly serviceable for purposes of
reference and comparative study. These storehouses of
bibliographical and literary wealth may be classified
into&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>(i) National or quasi-National Collections:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>The British Museum</li>
<li>Guildhall Library</li>
<li>South Kensington Museum (Dyce and Forster and General Fine Art Collections)</li>
<li>Society of Antiquaries</li>
<li>Dr. William's Library, Gordon Square</li>
<li>Chetham Library, Manchester</li>
<li>Spencer-Rylands Library, Manchester</li>
<li>Bodleian</li>
<li>University Library, Cambridge</li>
<li>University Library, Edinburgh</li>
<li>Advocates' Library, Edinburgh</li>
<li>Signet Library, Edinburgh</li>
<li>Hunterian Library, Glasgow</li>
<li>Trinity College, Dublin</li>
</ul>

<p>The British Museum readily divides itself, of course
very unequally, into the Printed Book and Manuscript
Departments, and each of these has been periodically
enriched by large donations or purchases <i>en bloc</i>, the
former more especially by the gift of the Grenville books,
and the latter by the Cottonian, Harleian, Lansdowne,
Stowe, and Hardwicke MSS. The Bodleian would fall
far short of what it is, had it not been for the bequests
of Tanner, Selden, Burton, Crynes, Gough, Malone, and
Douce, and so with the University Library at Cambridge,
which owes so much to Bishop Moore's books,
and Trinity, Dublin, to Archbishop Marsh's.</p>


<p>(ii) College Libraries:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>Sion College</li>
<li>Dulwich College</li>
<li>Eton College</li>
<li>Winchester College</li>
<li>Stonyhurst College</li>
<li>St. Cuthbert's College, Ushaw</li>
<li>Cambridge Colleges</li>
<li>Oxford Colleges</li>
</ul>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span></p>

<p>Sion College preserves a few items of the rarest and
most precious class&mdash;Shakespeare's <i>Lucrece</i>, 1594, Barnfield's
<i>Affectionate Shepherd</i>, 1594, the <i>Ph&oelig;nix Nest</i>,
1593, Drayton's <i>Matilda</i>, 1594, and others; but a few
specified in the old catalogue have disappeared. Many
of the most valuable volumes bequeathed by Edward
Alleyn to Dulwich are now among Garrick's books in the
British Museum, or among Malone's at Oxford, <i>by conveyance</i>;
but a few yet remain. Eton College Library
contains a small number of early printed books (including
Caxton's <i>Book of Good Manners</i>) and the unique copy of
Udall's <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>. At Winchester they have
a volume or two of very rare poetical tracts of Elizabeth's
and James I.'s time. Stonyhurst is solely remarkable for
MSS. and printed works of Robert Southwell and other
Romish writers.</p>

<p>Of the subordinate libraries at Oxford and Cambridge
the treasures are innumerable. Those which belong to
the printed department are very fully registered in special
catalogues and by Hazlitt, except, perhaps, the very
recent legacy to Trinity College, Cambridge, of the library
of the late Mr. Samuel Sandars, rich in early English
typography, and the result of life-long researches.</p>

<p>Outside these fall the Royal Library at Windsor,
which includes the unique perfect &AElig;sop, and one of the
two books on vellum (the <i>Doctrinal of Sapience</i>) printed
by Caxton; the Archiepiscopal one at Lambeth, rich in
rare early printed books and MSS., and the Chetham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>
and Rylands foundations at Manchester, the latter comprehending
the Althorp treasures <i>en bloc</i>. Humphrey
Chetham also established the Church Libraries at Turton
and Gorton, bibliographical notices of which have been
printed by Mr. Gilbert French, 4to, 1856; and a few
strays from the Chetham collection will be incidentally
mentioned hereafter.</p>

<p>A reference to the writer's <i>Collections</i>, where such facts
are not matters of familiar knowledge, will show that the
majority of this section is more remarkable for the possession
of a few rarities, or even unique items, than for a systematic
representation of classes and periods. Yet some are very
strong in specialities: Christ Church, Oxford, in music;
Magdalen, Cambridge, in early English books (Pepys's);
Corpus, Cambridge, in MSS. (Archbishop Parker's); the
Bodleian, in Shakespeariana, early popular books, Elizabethan
poetry, &amp;c. (Malone's, Douce's, Selden's, Burton's),
and so forth.</p>

<p>(iii) Cathedral Libraries:&mdash;</p>
<ul><li>St. Paul's, London</li>
<li>Canterbury (Christ Church)</li>
<li>York Minster and Chapter</li>
<li>Peterborough</li>
<li>Lichfield</li>
<li>Lincoln</li>
<li>Hereford</li>
</ul>

<p>At Lincoln there was formerly the precious Honeywood
bequest, improperly sold to Dibdin for 500 guineas; but
the library still contains about 5000 volumes, to which
the Dean and Chapter make additions from time to time;
and there is a paid custodian, who is one of the minor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
canons. York Minster and Chapter are rich in early
typography and Yorkshire books. The Cathedral library
is under the charge of a canon as librarian and a vicar-choral
as sub-librarian, who receive no salary. It is open
to the public on three days in summer and on two days
in winter in each week. There is no fund for the support
or improvement of the library, except the interest of &pound;400
and a few voluntary subscriptions. Hereford possesses a
remarkable assemblage of chained volumes. To the present
group most properly appertains the library at Westminster
Abbey, founded by Lord-Keeper Williams, while
he was Dean of Westminster.</p>

<p>(iv) Public Libraries on the Continent or in America:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris</li>
<li>French Institute (the gift of the late Duc d'Aumale), Chantilly</li>
<li>Vatican Library, Rome</li>
<li>Royal Library, Naples</li>
<li>Medicean Library, Florence</li>
<li>St. Mark's Library, Venice</li>
<li>Royal Library, Turin</li>
<li>Imperial Library, Vienna</li>
<li>Imperial Library, St. Petersburg</li>
<li>Royal Library, Berlin</li>
<li>Library of Electors and Kings of Bavaria, M&uuml;nich</li>
<li>Library of the Dukes and Kings of Saxony, W&ouml;lfenb&uuml;ttel</li>
<li>Landerbibliothek, Cassel</li>
<li>Public Library, Hamburg</li>
<li>Public Library, G&ouml;ttingen</li>
<li>Public Library, Z&uuml;rich</li>
<li>Archiepiscopal Library, Eichstadt</li>
<li>Archiepiscopal Library, Salzburg</li>
<li>Archiepiscopal Library, Worms, &amp;c.</li>
<li>Plantin Museum, Antwerp</li>
<li>University Library, Upsala</li>
<li>Royal Library, Copenhagen</li>
<li>Lenox and Carter Brown Libraries, New York</li>
</ul>

<p>The two last named, as it may be at once concluded,
are principally English and Anglo-American in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
character. Our collectors do not, as we are aware, by
any means restrict themselves to the literature of the
mother country so exclusively as their Transatlantic contemporaries;
and for them therefore it becomes of importance
and interest to acquire through catalogues a
familiarity with the contents of the leading assemblages
of foreign and classical literature in Continental hands.
But there are very few of the great public libraries abroad
which have not casually or otherwise acquired English
books, and those of the rarest description. At G&ouml;ttingen
they have, from an auction at L&uuml;neburg in 1767, the
<i>C. Merry Tales</i> of 1526; at Cassel, Marlowe's <i>Edward II.</i>,
1594; and at Hamburg the Elizabethan edition of <i>Blanchardine
and Eglantine</i>, 1597, all unique or most rare;
and this is only by way of instance or sample. The Huth
copy of Shakespeare's <i>Sonnets</i>, 1609, was obtained from
Z&uuml;rich.</p>

<p>The private amateur does well if he keeps before him
the salient features connected with his pursuit from this
point of view. It is to be deeply regretted that the
Government of the Netherlands did not take steps to
preserve intact the Enscheden collection at Haarlem, in
the same manner that that of Belgium did the Plantin
heirlooms.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Quaritch narrated an amusing and characteristic
anecdote, commemorative of his participation in the
Enscheden sale, where the agent of the British Museum
waited till the morning to bid at the table for the <i>Troy-</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span><i>Book</i>,
printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1502, and he
bought it privately over-night of the auctioneer.</p>

<p>There is, it must be noted, a fundamental difference
in the constitution of public libraries in Great Britain
and America as compared with those on the Continent.
The latter, if they do not restrict themselves, in principal
measure, to the literature of their own country, or at least
tongue, very seldom go far outside those limits otherwise
than by accident or for works of reference. On the
contrary, the English and American collections are cosmopolitan,
like those who have formed them. At the
British Museum a volume in Icelandic, Chinese, Hawaian,
or any other character is welcomed nearly as much as one
in the vernacular. In Germany, at all events at Berlin
and Vienna, English books of importance are recognised.
But at the Biblioth&egrave;que in Paris it is not so. The French
collect only the classics and their own literature, just as
they ignore in coins all but the Greek and Roman and
national series.</p>

<p>Within their own lines, however, it is wonderful,
looking at all the political convulsions which the country
and capital have undergone, what vast treasures remain
in France&mdash;treasures of all epochs and in every class,
from the rise to the fall of the monarchy, from volumes
written for the Carolingian, if not Merovingian kings,
to volumes bound for Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>Some interesting and instructive notices of our own
public libraries, and of a few private collections of former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
times, may be found in the later volumes of the <i>Retrospective
Review</i>.</p>

<p>The two <i>Rolls of Collectors</i> before mentioned are
capable of making a not inconsiderable volume; but
they are classifiable in groups and periods, and certain
individuals may be taken as the central figures in the
successive onward movements. Our immediate concern is
with printed monuments, and consequently we do not
hearken back beyond the men who witnessed the introduction
of typography. Nor does there appear, while
the purchasing power of money for literary possessions
or the book-closet was high, to have been any <i>esprit de
corps</i> or emulation tending to constitute schools or
<i>c&ocirc;teries</i>, and to raise certain books or series to an artificial
standard. Men at first acquired at random what
happened to fall in their way; booksellers there were
few or (except at London or in the Universities) next
to none; and auctions were long unknown. Except for
topography and the classics, there was, down to the
middle of the eighteenth century, no active competition.
The bulk of the Harleian Library was probably obtained
without extravagant outlay, though not without labour
and time; not those divisions which we should now prize
would be the most expensive, unless we include the
manuscripts for which Lord Oxford had even then to
pay a price.</p>

<p>We have drawn the line where it appears that the
principle of forming libraries, in the modern sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
of the word, commenced in this country. Down to
the Harleian epoch, when the Continental system began
to influence us, the shelf of books which we observe in
many old prints was the limit of nearly all collectors:
not necessarily of their resources, but of their views and
of the feeling of the time. Men acquired a handful or
so of volumes, which came into their hands by gift or
otherwise; from the absence or paucity of public institutions
there were few individuals of any culture
whatever without a few books besides the family Bible
and <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>; but such a colossal accumulation
as was formed under the auspices of the second Lord
Oxford, and still more that of Richard Heber, was as
undreamt of as the vast and multifarious contents of
the building in Great Russell Street as it now exists.
A study of early correspondence and other sources of
original information on the present point will be found
to corroborate such a view of the average private collection
in these islands anterior to the last century.</p>

<p>It was not till many years after the dispersion of
that noble Harleian memorial of generous ardour among
the public and private collections of England and the
Continent (Dr. Johnson in his letter to Sir F. Barnard,
1768, says that many books passed direct into the
<i>Biblioth&egrave;que du Roi</i> at Paris), that the Shakespeare revival
led to an inquiry, on the one hand, into the
literature connected with the Elizabethan period, and on
the other to a partial discovery of how much of it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
perished. That epoch may be regarded as the true
Hegira from which we have to date the modern annals
of collecting; the antecedent time was in a sense pre-historic,
for the most precious remains of our national
literature were unheeded and uncalendared; the means of
forming a comprehensive estimate of the printed stores in
actual existence were yet latent or unknown, and the
almost undivided attention of students and purchasers
was directed to the ancient classics and foreign typography.
It must be conceded, we think, that whatever
the importance of those branches of inquiry may be, the
cause of British letters is more closely and permanently
bound up with our own classics and the products of our
own soil; and we repeat that the movement which first
gave a stimulus to a sort of revolt from the Continental
school and to the formation of a native one was the
persuasion, on the part of a few scholars, that something
more was to be done towards popularising the plays of
Shakespeare and his more eminent contemporaries, and
elucidating their writings by the help of those who lived
amid the same scenes and habits of thought and under
the same institutions.</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt used to speak to me of having attended
the great Roxburghe sale in 1812 just for the sake of
gaining an idea of what such an affair was. It was, no
doubt, a fine collection which the noble owner and his
predecessors (particularly John, Earl of Roxburghe in the
time of Queen Anne) had acquired, mainly in the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>ceding
century, at very moderate prices; and the result
must have been highly satisfactory to the estate. But
many things have happened since then; the Heber
Library, the most extensive, most valuable, and most
ill-fated in its realisation: the grandest and proudest
bibliographical monument of the nineteenth or any other
century, has been completed and scattered; and yet
to-day, if the general reader were asked, he would probably
be of the belief that the first rank was due to the
earlier personage and collection. There is somehow a
prestige about the Roxburghe sale which time seems
incapable of weakening; yet in comparison with its successor
it was a mere handful; and in fact the accumulations
even of Harley, the second Earl of Oxford, vast and precious as
they may have been, were not equal in magnitude or
in value to those of Heber, of whom the most surprising
and most interesting trait is his conversance with the
interiors of so many of his treasures; nor should we
ever forget his generosity in lending them to literary
workers. The Rev. Alexander Dyce, who so ably edited
our elder dramatists and poets, could never have accomplished
his projects, if Heber had not come to his assistance
with the rare, or even unique, original editions.</p>

<p>We have taken elsewhere an opportunity of recording
the probable obligation under which we all lie to Heber
for his offices in prevailing on the Government under
the Regency to arrange the so-called gift to the country
of the library of George III. What an inestimable boon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>
and advantage it would have been, had he left us his
own magnificent gatherings, with the liberty of exchanging
duplicates! To how many a subsequent collection
would such a step have been the deathblow or rather
an insuperable bar! The Britwell and Huth libraries
would have been robbed of half their gems, and the
Daniel sale could not have proved the singular <i>coup</i>
and sensation which it was, had the Heber element
been absent.</p>

<p>The flyleaves of an enormous proportion of Heber's
books are found enriched by his scholarly and often
very interesting memoranda; they usually bear a stamp
with BIBLIOTHECA HEBERIANA, but never an <i>ex libris</i>. That distinction
the accomplished owner resigned to minor luminaries.
The notes are always pertinent and occasionally numerous;
and the pages of the sale catalogue, of which we have no
fewer than thirteen parts, are lifted above mechanical
common-place by the curious and varied matter interspersed
from this source, as well as to a certain extent
from the pen of John Payne Collier, who edited the
early poetical and dramatic portions, and attended the
auction to secure some of the rarest old plays for his
friend the Duke of Devonshire.</p>

<p>Heber had, in the course of a not very prolonged life
(he died at sixty), absorbed by degrees mainly all that
fell within his reach, both at home and abroad; and
he acquired much which never came to England, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
was warehoused at Antwerp or elsewhere on the Continent,
pending future arrangements, which he did not live to
make. The library is said to have cost &pound;150,000, and
to have fetched about a third of that sum. As the
owner had built it up from the ruins of others, so
some more recent collectors found there their opportunity.</p>

<p>A good deal of interesting information about this
once conspicuous figure in book-collecting circles may
be found in Dibdin's <i>Reminiscences</i>. Heber seems to
have inherited some shares in Elliott's brewery at Pimlico,
and a residence within the precincts. How far this fortune
contributed to enable him to devote so large an amount
to the purchase of books and MSS., we hardly know; it
was said that he derived advantage from the slave trade,
but perhaps this was a calumny. At any rate, there was
trouble which saddened his later years.</p>

<p>Mr. William Henry Miller of Craigentinny bought
nearly the whole of the early English poetry, and made the
Britwell Library what it was and is; and George Daniel
of Canonbury carried off, at what might have then seemed
exorbitant prices, the Shakespeare quartos, to have the
enjoyment of them for thirty years, and then leave them
as a valuable inheritance to his family; for his death
just occurred, when Henry Huth had begun to compete
more courageously for this class of books, and when the
National Library was in a better position to offer tall
figures for really vital acquisitions. It was in 1864,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
and the struggle for the quartos and a few other prizes
was principally between the British Museum, Mr. Huth,
and Sir William Tite.</p>

<p>At the present moment the Britwell collection is
probably, on the whole, the finest private library in
the kingdom; the founder of it was a solicitor in Edinburgh,
whose name already meets the eye as a purchaser
in 1819, when the Marquis of Blandford's books were
sold at White-Knight's, and it passed by bequest to
the Christy family, in whose hands it now remains.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Heber and for the bibliophobia
which prevailed, when his possessions came to the hammer
in 1834, it is doubtful whether Miller of Craigentinny
could have achieved the extraordinary <i>coup</i>, which he
did by transferring to his own shelves at one swoop the
harvest of a lifetime&mdash;a lifetime almost dedicated to
a single object.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> a long series of years it was my special good
fortune to see nearly every week the late Mr. Henry Huth,
and to learn from him many particulars of the sources
from which he had derived some of his fine and rare
books. We made Mr. Huth's acquaintance not long
after the enrichment of his library by the sale of George
Daniel's collection in 1864; and that, with his very important
acquisitions when Mr. Corser died, and his early
English poetry came into the market soon after, constituted
the backbone or stamina of the new-comer. Mr.
Huth did not collect on a large scale during a great
length of time; he made his library, or had it made for
him, chiefly between 1854, when he bought his first folio
Shakespeare at Dunn-Gardner's auction, and 1870. Once
or twice his health and spirits failed, and he was always
more or less desultory and capricious. We saw him one
afternoon, when he shyly mentioned that he had at last
taken courage to order home the Mazarin Bible, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
Mr. Quaritch had kept two years after giving &pound;2625
for it at the Perkins sale, and then sold to Mr. Huth
for &pound;25 profit. He did not show the book to us, for
he had not opened the parcel, and confessed that he
was rather ashamed of himself. A very curious circumstance
was that one of the Rothschilds, who had been
nibbling at the copy, called at Quaritch's a day or so
later, and was of course vexed to find that he had been
anticipated. Huth necessarily bought in every case, like
Addington and Locker, at the top of the market, for
he waited till the books were shown or sent to him; he
never searched for them. Condition governed his choice
a good deal; he was fond of Spanish books, his mother
having been a Spaniard, and of early German ones, being
a German on his father's side. He took the classics and
Americana rather hesitatingly, and there is no doubt that
the old English literature interested him most powerfully,
as it was most fully represented on his shelves. The folio
volume of black-letter ballads, knocked down to his agent
at the Daniel sale for &pound;750, was regarded by him with
special tenderness; but we think that its real history was
unknown to him. He was not aware that it was only
a selection by Daniel from a much larger number obtained
by Thorpe the bookseller from a private source, suspected
to have been a person in the employment of the Tollemaches
of Helmingham Hall, near Ipswich. Thorpe
parted with the bulk to Mr. Heber for &pound;200, and the
latter, in sending the vendor the money, declared how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
conscious he was of his extravagance, and asked whether
he had been so fortunate as to secure "the inheritance
of the Stationers' Company!"</p>

<p>A far more extensive collection, though of later date,
came some years afterward into Mr. Huth's possession;
it consisted of three hundred and thirty-four sheet ballads
of the Stuart period, which had formed part of a larger
lot bought at a house-sale in the West of England for
fifty shillings. Some went to the British Museum, some
elsewhere; Mr. Huth's share cost him &pound;500!</p>

<p>The Huth catalogue is a disappointing production,
owing to the circumstance that a good deal of useful
information was suppressed, and the opportunity was not
taken, where expense was the least object, to furnish an
exhaustive account of the books. It is singular that the
Grenville and Chatsworth catalogues were spoiled much
in the same way, and that Lord Ashburnham's own
privately printed account of his books is a thousandfold
inferior to the auctioneer's one.</p>

<p>The Duke of Roxburghe, Mr. Heber, Mr. Grenville,
Mr. Daniel, Lord Spencer, Mr. Miller and Mr. Huth
were seven personages who exercised on the printed book-market
in their time (to say nothing of MSS.) a very
notable influence, particularly Heber. One might add
the names of Mr. Jolley, Mr. Bright, and Mr. Corser, who
severally between 1810 and 1870 made their competition
sensible and raised the standard of prices for many classes
of old English books. It was said in 1845, when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
Bright Library was dispersed, that the advance in realised
values led some collectors to relinquish the pursuit. The
formation, not only of such a library as that of Heber or
Harley, but that of Corser or Daniel or Bright, will be in
the future a sheer impossibility from the absence of the
means of acquiring in many branches so large a proportion
of the rarer <i>desiderata</i>. To gather together a
collection of books on an extensive scale may always
remain feasible; but the probability seems to be that
assemblages of literary property outside mere works of
reference will show a tendency to distribute themselves
over a more numerous body of owners, including the
public repository, which year by year removes a certain
body of rare books of all kinds beyond the reach of competition.
The Bright episode was to a considerable extent
a duel between Mr. Corser and the British Museum.
But Mr. Miller and Lord Ashburnham, and (it may
be added) Mr. Henry Cunliffe of the Albany, were also
in the field; and two years prior, Maitland in his
<i>Account of the Early Printed Books at Lambeth</i>, 1843,
already takes occasion to animadvert on what he terms
the puerile competition for rarities, which had then
set in.</p>

<p>Miss Richardson Currer, of Eshton Hall, Craven,
Yorkshire, whose extensive and valuable library came to
the hammer in 1864, was one of the most distinguished
lady-collectors of the century. There is a privately printed
catalogue of the books, of which two editions appeared in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
1820 and 1833. Miss Currer was a competitor side by
side with those already named for a certain proportion
of the literary treasures which were in the market in her
time. The late Lady Charlotte Schreiber confined herself
to a few subjects, of which playing-cards were one; but
both these personages have been eclipsed in our immediate
day by Mrs. Rylands, who conceived, as a tribute to the
memory of a deceased husband, the princely design of
founding on the theatre of his commercial success a grand
literary monument, of which the Spencer books should be
the nucleus and central feature.</p>

<p>One of the greatest surprises of our time in a bookish
way was not the sale of the library at Althorp, which
had been rumoured as a contingency many years before it
occurred, but its transfer by the purchaser to Manchester.
We were all rather sorry to learn that the climax had
at length been reached; the sacrifice was doubtless a
painful one on more than one account; but it was presumably
unavoidable, and the noble owner was encouraged
by numerous precedents: the fashion for selling had quite
set in then. I visited Althorp in 1868 for the purpose
of examining some of its treasures. I remember the room,
and the corner of it where the largest private collection
of Caxtons in the world was kept, and the glass case
which enshrined quite a number of Elizabethan rarities.
His Lordship mounted a ladder to get me one or two of
his Aldines printed on vellum. He showed me a delightful
old volume of tracts, bound in a vellum wrapper, some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
absolutely unique, which his grandfather had bought, and
a copy of the romance of <i>Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion</i>, 1509,
which came out of a poor cottage in Lincolnshire. That
former Lord Spencer once did a <i>gentlemanly</i> act in handing
Payne the bookseller a <i>bonus</i> of &pound;50, on finding that
a volume he had had from him was a Caxton. Alas!
the spell is broken. Althorp was its library, and that
has left it for ever! <i>Sic transit gloria.</i></p>

<p>In the wake of the Spencer books have followed those
of the late Earl of Ashburnham, whose representative
had previously disposed of his father's coins and of some
of the MSS. The remainder of the latter still await
dispersion or a purchaser <i>en bloc</i>.</p>

<p>The Ashburnham printed books included a considerable
number of Caxtons and Wynkyn de Wordes, the
<i>St. Albans Chronicle</i> and <i>Book of Hunting</i>, &amp;c., printed
at the same place, and many distinguished rarities in
the foreign series of ancient typography; but first and
foremost the Perkins copy of the Gutenberg or Mazarin
Bible on vellum, which realised &pound;4000, being &pound;600 in
excess of the figure given by the buyer. There was also
the Bible of 1462 on vellum, which fetched &pound;1500.</p>

<p>But the prevalent characteristic of the collection was
an ostensible indifference on the part of the nobleman
who formed it to condition. There were several fine
books and interesting examples of binding; but the
absence of any definite plan and of judgment was conspicuous
throughout. Circumstances aided the immediate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
proprietor in his project for converting the property into
cash, and the prices reached were, in the cases of the
early printed volumes by Caxton and others, simply
unprecedented, looking at the sorry state of the copies
offered. The catalogue (sooth to speak) was not very
carefully or scientifically prepared, and when the important
lots were put on the table, the company had, as a
rule, some serious deduction to make from the account
printed by the auctioneers. The noble vendor did not
see anything unbecoming in attendance to note the prices
of lots during the earlier stages, and did not disguise his
gratification when a book brought a heavy profit. Yet
twenty years ago it was almost accounted a disgrace for
an ancient family even to part with its heirlooms. In
those cases, when want of the money cannot and is not
pleaded, the proceeding seems all the stranger and the
more discreditable. The late Lord bought at the right
time, and his son sold at the right time. The prices
realised were not merely high, but outrageous. Yet, after
all, prices are a figure of speech and a relative term. To
a wealthy Manchester manufacturer a thousand pounds
are nothing more than four figures on a piece of paper
instead of one or two, and the sole difference between
&pound;1000 and &pound;2000 is the substitution of one numeral
for another.</p>

<p>It was known, in a few cases, what the noble owner
had given for the articles. His <i>Jason</i>, printed by Caxton,
cost &pound;87 <i>plus</i> commission, and produced &pound;2100. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
<i>Merlin</i> of 1498 was bought for 30 guineas, and realised
&pound;760. A little French volume by Jean Maugin, <i>Les
Amours de Cupidon et de Psiche</i>, 1546, was carried to
&pound;60, having been acquired for half-a-crown. Certain
other antecedent quotations were left far behind, as in
the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> of 1498, which at Dunn-Gardner's
sale in 1854 brought &pound;245, and now went up to &pound;1000,
and in the Antonius Andreas of 1486, which was thought
worth &pound;231, as probably the earliest volume issued in the
City of London.</p>

<p>There was a notable drop in the biddings for the
imperfect copies of Chaucer from Caxton's press, and a
host of items went for next to nothing, which in an
inferior sale would have realised far more. It is ever
so; and of course there was half a century's interest on
the outlay. Still what an intense pleasure beyond money
it had afforded the nobleman who formed it! And let
us think, again, to how long a succession of holders the
same beautiful or rare book has been a friend and a
companion, a source of delight and pride!</p>

<p>It was remarked in the room that the present Earl
had enlarged his father's possessions only to the extent
of <span class="smcap">one volume</span> (No. 2748), for which he gave &pound;4, and
which yielded him &pound;7. He had no right to complain
so far.</p>

<p>Concurrently with the Ashburnham episode in 1897,
there came upon us all, like a shell, the extraordinary
report, which proved too true, not only that the repre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>sentative
of Johnson of Spalding had determined to part
with the valuable library preserved in the house since at
least the time of the Stuarts, if not of the Tudors, but that
Mrs. Johnson had actually called in a local clergyman
to select what books he deemed worthy of being sent up
to London for sale, and had committed the residue to
a local auctioneer. <i>The catalogues were partly distributed
before the books were added</i>, and very few booksellers were
even aware of the matter, till the sale was over. Not
more than three or so, and a few private persons, were
present; the volumes were made up in parcels and only
one mentioned, and the bidding did not exceed two or
three shillings a lot. Supposing 2000 items, comprised
in 100 bundles at 3s. each; the grand total would be
&pound;15! Blades quotes the library as containing seven
Caxtons, and the late Mr. Henry Bradshaw thought it
worth while to pay a visit to Spalding to make notes,
which he very kindly communicated to us. One of the
purchasers at the sale offered me two of his minor
acquisitions for &pound;30. Although the library included a
proportion of desirable articles, many of the books were
esteemed so worthless that the acquirers removed the
<i>ex libris</i>, and left the rest behind them!</p>

<p>Some of the Caxtons in the public library at Cambridge
have belonged to the Johnson family, and are
supposed to have been formerly presented to it by those
of Spalding. They were acquired in the earlier half of
the reign of Henry VIII. by Martin Johnson at the then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
current prices&mdash;from sixpence to a shilling or so; and a
stray or two from the same collection, long prior to the
dispersion of 1897, has occurred in the auction-rooms.
I have to mention in particular the <i>Spalding Chartulary</i>,
sold in 1871. But a few still remained on the old ground,
and fortunately five were bound up together in one
volume, which was not comprised in the wretched <i>fiasco</i>
and anti-climax. This precious collection was offered to
Mr. Jacobus Weale, while he was still curator at South
Kensington, for &pound;20, and declined, because, as an officer
of a public institution, he could not accept it at that
price, and was unable to pay the real value. Two, <i>Curia
Sapienti&aelig;</i>, by Lydgate, and <i>Parvus et Magnus Cato</i>, have
since been acquired by the British Museum, with five
excessively rare specimens of the press of Wynkyn de
Worde. The National Library did not require the <i>Reynard
the Fox</i> or the <i>Game of the Chess</i>.</p>

<p>The Spalding case was as unique as some of the books
themselves. The owner seems to have been grossly ignorant
of their value, as well as wholly indifferent to the
property as heirlooms.</p>

<p>Except as a matter of record and history, the collector
need not so greatly concern himself with all those
libraries which have been scattered, and yet he finds
it desirable to refer to the catalogues, if they were
publicly sold, in order to trace books from one hand
to another, till they return into the market and find
a new owner&mdash;perhaps himself. One might fill a volume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
with a list of all the sales which the last forty years
have witnessed; but, taking the principal names, let us
enumerate:&mdash;</p>

<p>Within these broad lines, which do not include libraries
privately acquired by institutions, such as the Dyce,
Forster, and Sandars, or by the trade, which is an almost
daily incidence, are comprehended a preponderant share
of all the important books which have come to the front
since the earliest period, of which there is an authentic
register.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
For we have to recollect that many of the persons
whose possessions were dispersed only in our time were
buyers a century or more ago, and had from Osborne, at
what still appear to our weak minds provokingly low
prices, his Harleian bargains. By the way, he kept
them a tolerably long time. Did some one help him
to find the money, or did he pay it by instalments?
Seriously speaking, it was rather a white elephant.
One of the most notorious private transactions in the
way of sales of books <i>en bloc</i> was that by the Royal
Society in 1873 of the printed portion of the Pirkheimer
Library, presented to it by Henry Howard, Duke
of Norfolk, the first president, and originally purchased
by his ancestor, the celebrated Earl of Arundel, in
1636.</p>

<p>The dispersion of the Harleian Library doubtless gave
an impetus to the revival in the eighteenth century of a
taste for book-collecting; but of course a large proportion
of the purchases from Osborne himself was on the
part of buyers who parted with their acquisitions, and
of whom we have no further record. But the Osterley
Park and Ham House collections, the latter still intact,
owed many indeed of their greatest treasures to this source.
In 1768 Dr. Johnson, who had had a leading hand in the
compilation of the Harleian Catalogue, and had so gained
a considerable experience of the bearings of the matter,
as they were then understood, addressed a long and interesting
letter to the King's Librarian on the subject of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>
the public collections of Europe and other bibliographical
particulars.</p>

<p>Of the libraries above mentioned, the Sunderland,
Syston Park (Sir John Thorold), and Hamilton-Beckford
collections owed their chief importance to early typography,
<i>editiones principes</i> of the classics, and bindings.
Among the Blenheim books were a few miscellaneous
rarities in the English class. Of Beckford's volumes many
contained his MSS. notes.</p>

<p>The Surrenden (Dering family), Stourhead (Sir Richard
Colt-Hoare), and Hartley libraries were historical and
topographical. In the Inglis, Dunn-Gardner, and Osterley
Park (Earl of Jersey) catalogues we encounter, among
a good deal that is more or less commonplace, the rarest
ancient typography, poetry, and romances.</p>

<p>We next approach the larger and more important
Private Collections of books, which are more or less of
a permanent and hereditary character, and which we have
to content ourselves with admiring at a distance or otherwise
according to circumstances. We cannot enumerate
the holders of a few volumes or so up and down the
country. The names of which we think are Devonshire,
Bute, Bath, Dysart, Bridgewater (Earl of Ellesmere),
Britwell, Huth, Aldenham (H. H. Gibbs), and Acton
(or Carnegie). The Duke of Fife is believed to possess
some curious books inherited from Skene of Skene. The
Duke of Northumberland owns a few, and a few are in the
possession of Lord Robartes at Llanhydrock, near Bodmin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>
Lord Aldenham, and Mr. Wynn of Peniarth. All these
centres affect the book-collector in one of two ways: in
showing him what exists, and in showing him now and
then what he is never likely to obtain. For in these
repositories there are actually certain things which have
never been offered for sale, and of which the most indefatigable
research has failed to bring to light other
examples. Such is not the case, however, with Lord
Acton's library at Aldenham Park, near Bridgnorth.
That is a collection made by a scholar for scholars; it
is wonderfully extensive and complete in its way, and
it were much to be desired that it should be preserved
intact. It commercial value is, relatively to its extent,
inconsiderable.</p>

<p>The collections at Chatsworth and Devonshire House
(including the books of Henry Cavendish and many of
those of Thomas Hobbes) principally consist of early
printed literature, English and foreign, and old plays;
of the latter the Kemble dramatic library formed the
<i>nucleus</i>, Payne Collier filling up at the Heber and other
sales many important <i>lacun&aelig;</i>. The late Duke ill-advisedly
engaged a foreign gentleman to compile his catalogue,
and the result is most unfortunate. Besides the Henry
Cavendish and Hobbes elements, a few very valuable
items came from the old library at Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The Althorp heirlooms, now removed to Manchester,
have been familiarised by the catalogues of them printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
by Dibdin; but there are hundreds of precious volumes
which he has overlooked, and of which some account is
given in the present writer's <i>Collections</i> from the books
themselves. An idea of the Dysart and Britwell libraries
is to be gathered from Blades's <i>Caxton</i>, Dibdin's <i>Ames</i>,
and Hazlitt's <i>Collections</i>. Of the possessions in this way
of the Marquises of Bath and Bute we gain only casual
glimpses from the same sources. Payne Collier and
Hazlitt have made the Bridgewater House library fairly
well known. The Huth one is elsewhere referred to, and
of Lord Acton's a sale catalogue of a portion was prepared
some years since, as well as a bibliographical
account; but the former was suppressed, and the latter
remains incomplete and in MS.</p>

<p>Of Lord Aldenham's collection (Early English Literature,
Bibles, Classics, MSS., &amp;c.) there is a privately
printed catalogue, 1888, and there is also one of the late
Mr. Locker-Lampson's literary treasures.</p>

rather languidly too, that it might be a "nice" thing

<p>There is probably not much of consequence to be
suggested outside this calendar from which an intending
collector may make his choice. Each of the topics
indicated is, for the most part, susceptible of being
subdivided and subdivided again.</p>

<p><i>Ancient Typography</i> is not only a large, but a difficult
and costly field. It is, notwithstanding, a not unusual
circumstance for a beginner, and not a rich one, to start
by making himself master of a few examples of our first
printers; and this arises from the fact that among the
remains in such a line of collecting are pieces of no high
interest or character, and copies whose condition does
not attract the riper connoisseur. At the same time it
arises from the feeling of the period which witnessed the
dawn of the art, that a heavy percentage of the output
of the printers of all countries amounts to little more
than typographical curiosities, which may be substantially
possessed in the form of an example of moderate cost.
The novice generally selects books and tracts of foreign
origin, and of a theological or technical complexion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
Perhaps he goes further&mdash;even so far as to discard his
earlier purchases; perhaps he does not. It is a matter of
taste and money. If he does not seek the finest and
rarest specimens, especially in the English series, it is not
too much to say that &pound;500 spread over a career would
suffice to procure one a fair representation in which
Fust and Schoeffer, Gutenberg, Mentelin, and Caxton
might appear in the form of a leaf&mdash;possibly a damaged
one. Yet there would be a chronological view in
actual originals of the art of printing from the commencement
in all countries. We go for our facts on
this subject to Panzer, Hain, Brunet, the British Museum
Catalogue, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>British History</i> and <i>Topography</i> are alike departments
which can scarcely be regarded as specialities
without questionable fitness. For when we survey the
catalogues of those who have professedly restricted their
aim to these two ranges, and reflect that all such collections
are, by the light of bibliographical authorities,
more or less tentative and imperfect, we are brought
to the conclusion that there would be, in a thoroughly
exhaustive treatment of the matter, less left outside than
could be found within. Of the divisions which present
themselves above so much is capable of being drawn
into the two other series. Numerically an assemblage
of ancient and modern books in these classes would be
by possibility immense. But the attendant outlay, unless
certain signal rarities were included, or it was deemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>
necessary to comprise all the poetical relics with a
historical or a topographical side, ought not to be
relatively so high as that on the preceding category,
particularly if the acquirer were satisfied here and
there with trustworthy reproductions of three-and-four-figure
items. From &pound;1000 to &pound;1500 will go a long
way in supplying a collection with that qualifying
proviso; without it, four times the amount would
barely cover you. The Hartley and Phillipps catalogues
should be consulted, as well as Upcott and other older
authorities.</p>

<p><i>Liturgies</i> form one of the tastes and objects of pursuit
of persons who have left behind them the fancies of their
novitiate, and possess the means of purchasing a description
of literature which is abnormally costly, and might
prove more so, were the buyers more numerous. The
editions of the Prayer-Book fall under this section, and
are almost innumerable, being tantamount to <i>Annuals</i>,
and of many years we possess more than one issue.</p>

<p>The printed <i>Books of Hours</i> might, from their extent,
as regards subordinate variations arising from the different
uses and occasional changes in portions of the
ritual, constitute in themselves a life's study and absorb
a fortune. There is great disparity in their typographical
and artistic execution, no less than in their commercial
value. A tolerably full description of the
series occurs in Brunet, Lowndes, Maskell, the British
Museum Catalogue, and in those of the principal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
collectors on these lines. Of those adapted to English or
Scotish uses there is an account in Hazlitt's <i>Collections</i>;
but we may look in the early future for an exhaustive
monograph from the pen of Mr. Jacobus Weale.</p>

<p>The British Museum is singularly rich in editions
in all languages of the <i>Imitatio Christi</i>, having enjoyed
the recent opportunity of supplying wants from an
enormous collection sold by public auction <i>en bloc</i>. The
Offor Catalogue is considered an authority on the <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i> and other works of Bunyan; but the
National Library contains a large proportion of these
books, and the Huth Catalogue and Hazlitt's <i>Collections</i>
must not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The authorities just cited, the Corser Catalogue, and
the publications of the Holbein Society, will prove useful
guides to any one desirous of studying the <span class="smcap">Emblem</span>
Series, which was some time since in marked request,
but has sustained the customary relapse, and is what
booksellers term rather <i>slow</i> just now. Our own literature
is not particularly wealthy in these productions;
there is nothing of consequence beyond Whitney, Peacham,
<i>The Mirror of Majesty</i>, 1618, Wither, Quarles, and
Harvey (<i>School of the Heart</i>). But if the collector goes
outside the national frontier, he meets with works of
this class in even bewildering abundance in regard to
number, variety of type and treatment, and degree of
artistic and literary merit. Moreover, among the works
of this species just enumerated as of national origin, four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
of the six were more or less heavily indebted to the Continent;
the Whitney was printed at Leyden, and Wither,
Quarles, and Harvey did little more than write English
letterpress to sets of foreign plates.</p>

<p><i>Books of Characters</i>, of which perhaps Earle's <i>Microcosmography</i>,
1628, is the most familiar, have attracted
attention from more than one of our book-fanciers; they
constitute a somewhat extensive series, and we gain a fair
<i>aper&ccedil;u</i> of it in the catalogue of the library of <span class="smcap">Dr. Bliss</span>,
of St. Mary's Hall, Oxford, 1858. It was Bliss who
reprinted Earle in 1811, and inserted a bibliography of
publications on similar lines.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned gentleman also lent himself to
two other paths of collecting: one suggested by local
associations, and consisting of works printed at Oxford,
the second dealing with those which appeared just prior
to the Great Fire of London in 1666.</p>

<p>One of Bliss's Oxford friends, <span class="smcap">Dr. Bandinel</span>, Bodley's
librarian, made it his speciality to bring together as
many of the fugitive publications as possible relative to
the Civil War Period and the Commonwealth, and <span class="smcap">Mr.
John Forster</span> did the same. The Bandinel Catalogue,
1861, is an excellent guide on this ground, although it
is almost unnecessary to state that it is very incomplete.
The best and most exhaustive assemblage of the literature
of the Troubles and Interregnum (1640-59) is the descriptive
list of the King's pamphlets in the British
Museum formed by Thomason the stationer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>
The interest and profit attendant on the study of the
monastic and patristic writers, who may be said to be less
strictly national and more cosmopolitan than those of
later schools, are, as a rule, casual and slender for the
merely literary consulter or peruser, supposing the rather
extreme case, where such a person is sufficiently courageous
and robust to engage in anything approaching a serious
examination of these families of books. The authors were
true enthusiasts, labouring to their lives' last thread in
some obscure cell or dim closet, where pride of authorship,
as we may feel and enjoy it, there was none, when
beyond the walls of a convent or those of a native town
their names were unknown, their personality unrecognised.
Except to the theologian or ritualist how repellent and
illegible this mass of printed and manuscript matter
must ever seem! How deficient in human sympathy
and pertinence! These treatises, so erudite, so prolix,
and so multifarious, were composed by men (Universal,
Irrefragable, or Seraphic Doctors), and after a certain
date by women too (Angelical Sisters), who had no knowledge
of the world, of society, of human nature, or of
real philosophy. Yet they were, and long remained, the
class of literature most cultivated, most studied, and
most multiplied; and to this hour, notwithstanding the
destruction of millions of them, they abound in our
national, cathedral, and college libraries, and in private
collections dedicated to that particular side of inquiry
and learning. In the booksellers' catalogues we some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>times
meet with examples, which are recommended to
the curious buyer by their illustrations of conventual
life, and their exposure of those vices which a state of
celibacy is calculated to promote in both sexes. The
chained book is not an uncommon feature in the ancient
ecclesiastical repositories, and even in certain churches;
and apart from the Scriptures, it almost invariably enters
into the department of early divinity or polemics.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of this branch of the
theological library, there is an undoubted market for it,
or some portions of it, as stocks are kept both here and
abroad, although on a more restricted scale, perhaps,
than formerly. It is extremely probable that, if any
one who was learned enough and dexterous enough should
make a decoction of all the uncountable folios which
exist up and down the globe, the result might be a single
volume of not very ample dimensions, affording its share
of insight and edification.</p>

<p>The call on the part of a narrow coterie of churchmen
for the Catholic literature of the sixteenth and succeeding
centuries, more especially the books produced at Continental
presses, necessarily resulted in the rapid inflation
of the value, while it brought to light from numberless
recesses a vast assemblage of works previously undescribed
and unknown. Many of these works were produced at
obscure localities in France and the Netherlands; but
Paris, Douay, Brussels, Antwerp, Mecklin, Tournai,
Bruges, Ghent, Breda, are responsible for a majority.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>
Besides the purely religious publications, quite a large
number of secular books, and those of permanent and
striking interest, owed their origin to the same region,
particularly to Amsterdam, the Hague, Middelburg,
Dort. The source of all this foreign production was
mainly either the employment of Englishmen and Scots
abroad on military service, or their residence there in
exile or for other purposes. Italy, Switzerland, Germany,
and even Poland, lent their presses to the British author;
the scarce tracts by James Crichton (the Admirable) proceeded
from Milan or Venice. We know what important
centres for English controversial divinity and political
pamphleteering were Geneva, Basle, and Z&uuml;rich, and the
last-named place is particularly associated with the name
of Christopher Fr&ouml;schover, printer of the Bible of 1550.
A distinct feature in this vast body of Continental typography
connected with us is the curious and often unique
light which it incidentally throws on the lives of our
countrymen and countrywomen, segregated by their
employments or opinions from their compatriots at
home, and obliged to resort to printers ignorant of the
language which they committed to type. A tolerably
exhaustive estimate may be found of this branch of the
subject by a reference to the <i>General Index</i> of Hazlitt's
<span class="smcap">Collections</span> (1867-91).</p>

<p>To the Duke of Sussex's Catalogue, and those of
Lea Wilson, George Offor, Francis Fry, William Maskell,
W. J. Loftie, W. J. Blew, Farmer-Atkinson, Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
Ashburnham, and the Rev. W. Makellar of Edinburgh,
we must go for the means of bibliographically estimating
the editions of the Scriptures and the Prayer-Book; and
the Huth and Caxton Exhibition Catalogues should
be consulted. The ordinary English and American collector
seldom goes beyond English, French, German,
and Latin Bibles. Of all these, not even excepting the
Fust and Gutenberg or Mazarin, the original impression
of the Scriptures in French, published at Paris and
Antwerp in six volumes between 1523 and 1528, is by
far the rarest; and the next place or rank is perhaps
due to the German one, printed at Z&uuml;rich in the same
number of volumes, 1527-29, of which an imperfect copy
is in the Huth Library. The Mazarin Bible has grown
rather commoner of late years. It is certainly much
more so than Coverdale's English one of 1535 in a
perfect state, or Tyndale's New Testament of 1526. It
is a point about it not generally known, that the extant
copies on vellum and on paper differ.</p>

<p>For History, Genealogy, Topography, and well-nigh
all other branches of human science, the student finds
himself referred to the Middle-Hill Library, now in
course of gradual dispersion; but this is far richer in
the manuscript than in the printed book department.
He may also profitably consult the catalogues of Mr.
Hartley and Mr. Tyrrell (City Remembrancer), of whom
the second collected largely on London.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton Corney, Mr. Grenville, and Mr. Jadis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>
made voyages and travels, books relating to America,
and the first-named literary <i>adversaria</i>, distinct features
in their enormous aggregate of volumes.</p>

<p>Information on early English poetry and the drama
may be sought in the catalogues of Sykes, Perry, Caldecott,
Heber, Chalmers, Jolley, Wolfreston, Way, Daniel,
Corser, Collier, Frere, Bliss, Bright, Mitford, Ouvry,
Bandinel, Halliwell-Phillipps, and of course Huth.</p>

<p>Mr. Brook Pulham concentrated his attention on the
writings of George Wither, Mr. Bragge on works illustrative
of Smokers and Tobacco, and Major Irwin on
the occult and supernatural.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Pyne during a long series of years made
an extensive collection, restricted to English books dated
prior to the year 1600, and as a rule, it must be added,
to the commoner class of publications.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voyages</span> and Travels have always engaged a large share

very interesting feature of almost the entire body of
early Americana, dealing with the discovery and colonisation
of that continent. This part of the subject before
us has received, owing to recent political occurrences, a
further development in the direction of Africa. To the
purely American collector, who of course takes in Canada,
his own literary heirlooms are unexceptionally material;
and if he works on a comprehensive principle, he admits
every item relevant to the series, however costly and
however individually trivial. An Englishman, as a rule,
is content with typical or representative examples. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>
late Mr. Huth long remained unpersuaded that books
of this character were <i>desiderata</i>.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, however&mdash;and Mr. Huth
concurred so far from the outset&mdash;that there are certain
Anglo-American works which are, so to speak, indispensable
to a library of any pretensions. For instance, it
must not be without such capital productions as those
written or published in elucidation of the history of the
New World by Drake, Cavendish, Hakluyt, and Purchas;
or such, again, as contribute to throw light on the settlement
of New England and the progress of the Pilgrim
Fathers. This group of literature has grown within the
last twenty years almost unattainable by the less opulent
bibliophile; its commercial value has risen to four times
that to which the previous generation was accustomed.
The most signal feature in the whole series is, however,
out of the pale of commerce. The precious manuscript
found at Fulham Palace in 1896, giving a detailed account
of the settlement of New Plymouth, has by a graceful
international act been restored, as it were, to its fittest
home, although many of us in Old England would have,
no doubt, preferred to see it deposited in Great Russell
Street.</p>

<p>There is another source of association with the mother
country which commends to the notice of many, not
exclusively American in their tastes or objects, the literary
memorials of Maryland and Pennsylvania, so intimately
associated with the English families of Calvert and Penn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
There is no rarer volume among the first Anglo-American
monuments than Hariot's <i>Virginia</i>, 1588, which is worth
from &pound;100 to &pound;120.</p>

<p>Among the favourite books of travel are Sir John
Mandeville's <i>Voyages</i>, of which there are ancient editions
in English, French, Italian, and German, and which is
being constantly reproduced with the quaint illustrations.
The narratives of Pinto, "prince of liars," and Bruce are
gaining increased credit and confidence. Leo's <i>Description
of Africa</i>, in the English version of 1600, has a map
already showing the source of the Nile in an inland lake.
The labours of the Hakluyt and Geographical Societies
have conferred respectively great benefits on the cause of
discovery and verification.</p>

<p>In the famous <i>Letter of Columbus</i>, 1493, in its
various forms, the <i>Mundus Novus</i> and <i>Paesi Retrovate</i>
(1507) of Vespucci, and a few other leading publications,
there is a recognised interest regardless of the countries
of origin.</p>

<p>We owe to the entrance into the lists of sundry
members of the medical profession a temporary emergence
from oblivion and respite from the waste-basket of what
the booksellers describe in their catalogues as "Rare
Early Medical." There is no doubt that among these
obsolete publications may be detected many curious points
and many evidences of former acquaintance with supposed
latter-day inventions or ideas. A prominent feature in
the series is Harvey's Latin treatise on the circulation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>
the blood, of which he was the (rather late British) discoverer.
But, on the whole, the group of early works
dealing with medicine and surgery is of questionable
interest outside the purely practical range as a comparative
study, and those which treat of anatomy and
other cognate topics are in the last degree gruesome.
They are the antipodes to the <i>belles lettres</i>.</p>

<p><i>Occult Literature</i> is susceptible of a division into
several classes or sections: Religious Cults, Necromancy,
Magic, Second Sight, Divination, Astrology, Palmistry,
of which all have their special literatures and bibliographies.
Major Irwin recently sold an extensive series
of works on these and kindred topics. Cornelius Agrippa,
Ashmole, Bulwer, Lilly, Partridge, Gadbury are among
the foremost names of older writers in the present categories.
But for the faiths and worships of antiquity
which may be ranked in the first order of importance
and solid interest, we chiefly depend on modern books,
such as Payne, Knight, Inman, Davies, Forlong; and
there is quite a small library on that branch which
touches on theosophy and similar speculations&mdash;all having
a common source in the grand principle of Agnosticism.
Further information will be found collected on this and
the topics which we notice below in Hazlitt's <i>Popular
Antiquities</i>, 1870.</p>

<p>For those who are interested in Portents, Phenomena,
<i>Lusus Natur&aelig;</i>, Murders, Earthquakes, Fires, there is the
catalogue of <span class="smcap">Mr. Nassau</span>, 1824. The British Museum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
has in recent times grown more complete in the same
direction. The founders and earlier curators of the
institution appear to have regarded such <i>nug&aelig;</i> as beneath
the dignity of a national library; but in fact the
information which they, and possibly they alone, convey,
is frequently of historical, biographical, or topographical
relevance.</p>

<p>There has been a rather marked tendency to a rise
in the value of a section of technical publications which
deals with the earliest notices in English literature of
such subjects as Electricity, the Microscope, the Steam-Engine,
the Paddle-Wheel, and the Telephone, and the
books identified with these subjects are now commanding
very high prices. An uncut copy of Thomas Savery's
<i>Navigation Improved</i>, 1698, where the principle of the
paddle-wheel is discussed, fetched at Sotheby's in June
1896, &pound;16, 15s.</p>

<p>This is a somewhat fresh departure, but it is not an
unsound or unreasonable one, and the series is limited.
An almost invariable incidence of these artificial figures
is to draw out other copies, and then the barometer
falls.</p>

<p>The name of <span class="smcap">Mr. Eyton</span> is identified with copies of
books printed on vellum or on some special paper, not
unfrequently for his own use or pleasure; and this gentleman's
catalogue is serviceable to such as desire to follow
his precedent, of which the modern <i>Edition de Luxe</i> is
an outgrowth. Eyton would have proved an invaluable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
friend to Japanese vellum, had he belonged to a later
decade of the century.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chap-Book</span>, which dates from the reign of Elizabeth,
and was sold for a silver penny of her Highness,
becomes less rare under the Stuarts, and common to
excess at a later period down to our own days. A large
proportion of this species of literature consists of abridgments
of larger works or of new versions on a scale suited
to the penny History and Garland. Pepys was rather
smitten with those which appeared in and about his
own time, and at Magdalen, Cambridge, with the rest
of his library, a considerable number of them is bound
up in volumes, lettered <i>Penny Merriments</i> and <i>Penny
Godlinesses</i> respectively. The Huth Collection possesses
many which were formerly in the Heber and Daniel
libraries. All these productions share the common attributes
of very coarse paper, very rough cuts, and very
poor type. They are interesting as eminently <i>folk-books</i>&mdash;books
printed for the multitude, and now, especially
when the article happens to be of unusual importance
and rarity, worth several times their weight in gold.
Two catalogues of Chap-Books and Popular Histories
were edited by Mr. Halliwell for the Percy Society in
1848-49.</p>

<p>In the present writer's bibliographical works, to which
there is a General Index, will be found an account of all
that have come into the market between 1866 and 1892.
Thousands upon thousands have unquestionably perished.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>
The most fascinating member of the Chap-Book series
is undoubtedly the <i>Garland</i>&mdash;not so much a volume by
a given author, such as the <i>Court of Venus</i> (1558) and
Deloney's <i>Garland of Good Will</i>, 1596, as a miscellany
by sundry hands. The next earliest of these collections
known to us at present are the <i>Muses' Garland</i>,
1603, and <i>Love's Garland</i>, 1624. Those in Pepys's
library at Cambridge are of much later date, yet of some
no duplicates can be quoted, so vast has been the destruction
of these <i>ephemerides</i>. Of the Pepysian Garlands
a certain proportion are reprints of older editions or
repositories of songs and ballads belonging to an anterior
date, and here and there we meet with lyrics extracted
from contemporary dramatic performances.</p>

<p>Besides Pepys, Narcissus Luttrell the Diarist displayed
a taste for fugitive and popular publications, and the
copies acquired by him eventually found their way, for the
most part, into Heber's hands, whence they have drifted
in large measure either into the British Museum or the
Miller and Huth collections. Numerous unique examples
of the popular literature of his own day, again, are preserved
among Robert Burton's books in the Bodleian.</p>

<p>Allied to the chap-book are the broadsides of various
classes, including the Ballad, popular and political, the
Advertisement and the Proclamation. So far as we know,
the second division exhibits the most ancient specimen
in our own literature, and is a notification on a single
leaf by Caxton respecting Picas of Salisbury use. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[<a href="./images/78.png">78</a>]</span>
precious relic, of which only two copies are recorded,
appeared about 1480. It must have been soon after the
introduction of printing into London and Westminster
that resort was had to the press for making public at
all events matters of leading importance; but we do not
seem to possess any actual evidence of the issue of such
documents save in isolated instances till toward the end
of the century, and they are chiefly in the shape of
indulgences and other ecclesiastical manifestos, circulated
in all probability in the most limited numbers and peculiarly
liable to disappearance.</p>

<p>The Ballad proper cannot be said to be anterior to
the closing years of Henry VIII., subsequently to the fall
of Cromwell, Earl of Essex, when the composition relative
to that incident printed in the collections appeared, and
was followed by the series preserved in the library of the
Society of Antiquaries of London, and reprinted in the
writer's <i>Fugitive Tracts</i>, 1875. From the time of Elizabeth
onward the broadside in its varied aspects grew
abundant, and served as a substitute for newspaper
notices, so long as the press remained an insufficient
medium. The British Museum and Society of Antiquaries
possess large collections of this kind. Lord Crawford
has printed a catalogue of his <i>Proclamations</i>, and
in the writer's <i>Collections</i>, 1867-92, occur thousands of
these ephemerides arranged under what appeared to be
their appropriate heads.</p>

<p>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>
sheet <i>format</i> lent itself largely and conveniently to
teachers, quack doctors, astrologers, announcing their
addresses, qualifications, and terms, no less than to the
official, municipal, or parochial authorities, and to private
persons who desired to give publicity to some current
matter by the exhibition of the placard on a wall or a
church door. There was yet another purpose which the
broadside was made to serve: prospectuses of schemes
and reports of companies' or societies' proceedings. The
purely temporary interest of such publications accounts
for their survival in unique examples and even fragments.</p>

<p>There is a general notion that the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i>
and the <i>Somers Tracts</i> represent between them a very
large proportion of the extant pamphlets and broadsheets
published during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
But, as a matter of fact, they do nothing of the sort.
Even in or about 1695 William Laycock of the Inner
Temple drew attention to the unsuspected importance
of these fugitive publications in his printed proposal for
buying them up by a public subscription; but even in
the National Library, with all its immense accumulations,
and in Hazlitt's <i>Collections</i>, many thousands of items are
probably deficient; while the two sets of books above
mentioned contain a very slender percentage of the whole&mdash;in
fact, mere representative selections.</p>

<p>There have been men who coupled with a general
plan a speciality or two. For instance, Dyce, who laid a
collateral stress on <i>Shakespeariana</i>; Ireland, who made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>
himself strong in Leigh Hunt and Hazlitt; Crossley, who
had a peculiar affection for Defoe; Bliss, who collected
books of characters and books printed at Oxford or
just before the Great Fire of 1666; Bandinel, who was
smitten by the charms of the Civil War literature;
Corser, whose bibliographical sweethearts were Nicholas
Breton and Richard Brathwaite; and Rimbault, who
had two, Old Music and Old Plays. Mr. G. L. Gomme
is similarly situated: anthropology and folklore are his
foibles. It goes without saying that the Shakespearian
and dramatic student, from Sir Thomas Hanmer downward,
has usually made a stand on the literary remains
and works tending to illustrate their own labours; but
of course the relevance may be direct or indirect, and in
the latter case the specialist is found to cast his net
surprisingly wide.</p>

<p>Specialism, whether on the principle of personal taste
or of particular studies, has manifest advantages in an
age where the multitude and choice of books are so
bewildering, where of every work of any sort of value
or interest a man may have, not a single edition&mdash;all
that in a majority of instances was once available&mdash;but
a hundred or a thousand in all sorts of sizes and at all
sorts of prices. With the discontinuance of the older
paucity of literature, the facilities for lodging within a
modest bookcase a coterie of literary favourites have
sorrowfully decreased, and a collector finds it imperative
to draw the line more and more rigidly, if he does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>
care to fall into one of two perils&mdash;excessive outlay or
excessive bulk. For we have not, as regards the former,
to go very far before we incur a serious expense, if it
happens that the run is on the rarer English section or
on what constitutes a picked library of the French type.</p>

<p>Of the miscellaneous group there are graduated and
varying types. The omnivorous accumulator, especially
where he does not insist on condition or binding, is the
dealer's idol. In the forefront of this class stand <i>facile
principes</i> Richard Heber and Sir Thomas Phillipps, for
the reason that they bought everything&mdash;whole libraries
and catalogues at a swoop. Yet both these distinguished
men have to be placed on a distinct footing from the
normal promiscuous buyer, such as Thomas Jolley, Joseph
Tasker, Edward Hailstone, Edward Solly, and a legion
of others, to whom anything in the guise of a book was
a sure bait, and who spurned Evelyn's motto: "<i>Meliora
retinete</i>." Ascending a step or two higher, we come to
the men who repudiate specialism as narrowing and
troublesome, and who impose on themselves no restraint
save perchance in the direction of theology, science, and
<i>arcana</i>. They stop peremptorily at the <i>belles lettres</i>.
Singer, Mitford, Bliss, Bandinel, Forster, Cosens, Ireland,
Crossley, Sir John Simeon, were more or less of this
school. At a still greater altitude we meet with a yet
stronger tendency to draw the line at character or
condition, and there occur to us the names, under the
former head, of Capell, Malone, Douce, Bright, Chalmers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
Collier, Ouvry, Bolton Corney, David Laing, E. F. Rimbault,
Halliwell-Phillipps, Frederick Locker, W. H.
Miller, Henry Cunliffe, R. S. Turner, and Henry Huth.
From the same point of view, nearly in the clouds are
discovered a small knot of fastidious <i>dilettanti</i>, who
purchase a volume in the same spirit as they might do
a picture or a piece of majolica; and of this minority
Sir Andrew Fountaine, Sir David Dundas, and Samuel
Addington may perhaps be accepted as types.</p>

<p>The most interesting, and it may with permission be
added, intelligent type of book-collector, however, seems
to be that where, after a certain measure of preparatory
thought and training, one confines acquisitions for permanent
ownership to volumes for which the acquirer has
a genuine personal relish. In general, the principle of
forming a library on this wholesome basis would be found
not only more useful, but more economical, since the
rarest and costliest articles are by no means, on the
whole, the most interesting or the most instructive.
In any case, the inconsiderate emulation by one collector
of others, who may have different objects and perhaps
ampler resources, is a course to be avoided. Even here
there is more than a single source or ground of inducement
to purchase. Setting aside the mere book of
reference, which has to be multiplied to suit various
exigencies, there may be said to be three classes of
literary property which rationally appeal to our sympathy:
(i) the volume which commends itself by its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>
intrinsic value and charm; (ii) that which has grown
dear from lengthened companionship and possibly hereditary
link; (iii) and that which, unimportant so far as
its internal claims and merits are concerned, bears on its
face the evidence of having once belonged to a favourite
of our own or a world's hero.</p>

<p>One persuasive argument in favour of adopting the
miscellaneous or typical course in the choice of a library
is the rapid growth of the difficulty of meeting with the
rarer items in all important specialities. It is the general
plan on the part of every follower of particular lines to
commence, very often casually, by bringing home from
time to time a few volumes on a certain topic, or in a
given class of literature, or by one or two of a school
of writers; and such a proceeding succeeds tolerably well,
till the owner makes discovery of volumes positively
essential to his object, and unattainable save by a heavy
outlay&mdash;perchance not even to be had at any price. It
is nearly always the <i>lacun&aelig;</i> for which we yearn; one or
two of our richer friends have them, and we have not.
What we possess anybody can get in a morning's walk;
we find that we have travelled a long distance, and have
come to an <i>impasse</i>. It is very seldom indeed that a
man is satisfied with the cheaper and commoner articles
in a series, if he is aware of the existence of those which
just constitute the corner-stones of such a collection as
his.</p>

<p>On the contrary, by the process of sampling or picking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>
out here and there, now and again, a book or a set of
books which chance or circumstances may throw in our
path, we may gradually acquire a caseful of most desirable
specimens, against which it is out of the question
to raise any charge of incompleteness, where incompleteness
is the governing aim. Book-buying under these
conditions is a humour. We are at liberty to take or
leave. Because we conceive a fancy for a work by this
or that author, we feel under no obligation to accommodate
every scrap which he has printed, or which his
friends or followers have penned. The object of our
personal selection suffices us; and there perhaps we begin
and we end. It is our humour.</p>

<p>The auctioneers' and booksellers' catalogues of the
present day supply an instructive demonstration of the
gradual withdrawal from the market of many thousands
of articles, in Early English literature more particularly,
which at one time seemed to be of fairly frequent recurrence.
They have been taken up into public collections
all over the world; and the very few copies, not to speak
of unique examples, which time had spared, are beyond
the reach of the private purchaser of to-day. We have
only to study with attention the Heber and other leading
records of former libraries existing in this and other
countries to become convinced that the facilities for
acquiring an approximately complete library of the rarer
books grow narrower year by year.</p>

<p>There is, I submit, far too prevalent a tendency in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>
collectors to follow suit, to attach themselves to leaders
of temporary fashions. I plead for a greater independence
of opinion, where the taste is in any reasonable
measure cultivated and developed, or, again, where an
individual knows what pleases himself. By all means,
if it happens that he does not admire Shakespeare and
Bacon, Sydney and Jonson, Dryden and Pope, Byron
and Shelley, Scott's novels or Lamb's <i>Elia</i>, let him leave
them alone, and make his own free choice, even if it be
to go in for <i>John Buncle</i>, the <i>Adventures of a Guinea</i>, or
Luttrell's <i>Letters to Julia</i>. There is always the room for
hope that he may quit those pastures after a time and
seek more fruitful ones. What is important and desirable,
however, is that each person should be his own
caterer. Schools are only useful where some writer of
real genius has been neglected or overlooked, or been
boycotted by the press, and attention to his works is only
a fair service to him, or a becoming, if tardy, tribute to
his memory.</p>

<p>Apropos of the increasing difficulty of obtaining
certain old books noted above, the extensive scale on
which reproductions of original editions of Early English
literature have of recent years been made is certainly a
boon to literary inquirers, since the presence of such
reissues in our circulating libraries, if we do not choose
to buy them, tends at every step in many branches of
work to help us, and to render our undertakings more
complete. It frequently occurs that volumes and tracts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>
which are of very slight literary or intrinsic value, contain
valuable allusions and illustrations, which we might miss
in the absence of available copies. It is worth while to
take in one's hand even some puerile trifle by the author
of <i>Adonais</i>, if one is not obliged to buy it or asked to
become the possessor. One feels a curiosity to glance
for a moment at a volume which, we are constantly
assured in the catalogue, the writer did his utmost to
obliterate; and we sometimes wish that he had fully
succeeded.</p>

<p>Any of us, taking in his hands the series of <i>English
Book-Collectors</i> in course of issue by Mr. Quaritch
(Nos. 1-12), will perceive without difficulty, if he go
no farther, the two distinct camps, so to speak, into
which the collecting fraternity may be, and is, broadly
divided and classifiable. You have, on the one hand,
the men who followed their personal taste, and amused
their leisure in late years after a busy life by purchasing
such works or such descriptions of literature as appealed
to them and fell within their resources; again, the
scholar or investigator who assembled round him what
illustrated his studies, not merely with an aim at
emulating others; or, once more, the gentleman of
fortune, who evolved from his school-day acquisitions
a feeling or a passion for higher things, and made it
the business of his maturer time&mdash;even made it his
career&mdash;to carry out on a scale and on lines dictated
and governed by circumstances the predilection formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>
in boyhood. On the contrary, there are for our consideration
and instruction the libraries which owed their
existence to less interesting motives, to the vague and
untrained pursuit of rare and expensive books and MSS.,
on the judgment of others in rivalry of others, and the
enterers into the field of competition with a practical eye
and a financial side-look. Of all these great divisions
there are varieties naturally arising from personal character;
but of the collector pure and simple of the older
school, that type, we avow, most warmly and potently
attracts us which limited itself to the small and unpretentious
book-closet, with just those things which the
master loved for their own sakes or for the sakes of the
donors&mdash;where the commercial element was wanting, and
where the library was not viewed in the same light as
railway or mining stock. It is a famous principle to
invest money prudently and well; but happy is he who
is wise enough to keep his library within narrow limits,
and rich enough to leave it, such as it may be, out of the
category of realisable assets.</p>

<p>Mr. Quaritch's project possesses in our eyes the
incidental merit of providing us with personal accounts
in a succinct form of many of the past proprietors of
English and American libraries, and enables us to see
at once how varied and fortuitous were the conditions
under which the task was begun and accomplished, with
what different measures of success and financial means;
and in what a preponderance of instances it was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>
individual rather than an hereditary trait. Broadly
speaking, we recognise two varieties of collector from
all time: the one who confers his name on a library,
and the other whose library confers a name on him.</p>

<p>Even the family of genuine book-lovers&mdash;neither
virtuosos nor speculators&mdash;presents more than a single
type to our notice. We have the student who takes
a subject for treatment, and forms a small gathering
of the literary material necessary for his purpose, shooting
it back perchance into the market, his immediate
task accomplished. There is the man like Coleridge,
who regarded the volumes which fell in his way as
casual and welcome visitors, of whom he asked questions,
or who answered his, and whose margins gave themselves
up to his untiring habit of registering whatever occurred
to him, before the passing&mdash;possibly borrowed&mdash;volume
went on its way again. There is Lamb, who was less
addicted to annotating his acquisitions, but who gave
them a permanent home, if they had come to him <i>jure
emptionis</i>, and were of the elect&mdash;not presentation&mdash;copies,
cold and crude, thrust into his hand by some
well-meaning acquaintance. There is Edward Fitzgerald,
dissimilar from all these, yet so far cognate that he
bought only the books which struck him as worth
reading, if not turning to some practical account. Nor
should we in strict fairness refuse admittance within this
highest circle even to such as Selden, Burton, Pepys,
and others who might be easily enumerated, who may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>
have been little more than curiosity-hunters, but who
had a genuine relish for pieces of old popular literature,
the greatest rarities in the language inclusive, when
there was barely any competition for them. The man
of the old school, who ransacked the shops and the
stalls, and even attended the auction, may have been
a faddist and a superficial student; but his was an
honest sort of zeal and affection; there was no vanity
or jealousy; and we meet with cases where one collector
would surrender to another an acquisition which the
latter happened to have missed, and to want very badly
indeed. So Isaac Reed gave up to George Steevens
Marlowe's <i>Dido</i>, and so George III. enjoined his agent
not to bid for him against a student or a scholar.</p>

<p>I have not yet quite done with this aspect of the
matter. I have to speak of the personages who have
thought fit to impose on themselves a chronological or
a financial limit, who drew the line at a given year, or
would not go beyond a certain figure. Mr. Henry Pyne
laid down 1600 as the latest date which he would admit,
and rarely exceeded a sovereign or two for a single
article (Dr. Doran gave me to understand that fourpence
was <i>his maximum</i>). It may appear strange to
suggest that the higher the sum paid for a book (assuming
it to be worth the money), the slighter the risk grows of
the purchase proving pecuniarily unprofitable. Yet at the
same time outlay on a library is a relative term, and
one individual may account himself as frugal in expend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[<a href="./images/90.png">90</a>]</span>ing
&pound;30,000 in the course of a lifetime, as another may
do in expending &pound;300. The late Earl of Ashburnham
bought in chief measure during the forties and fifties,
when the reaction from the bibliomania still more or
less sensibly prevailed, and considering his Lordship's
position and resources, he was not much more lavish
than the above-mentioned Mr. Pyne, or indeed any other
amateur of average calibre, while he was to the full
extent as genuine a follower of the pursuit for its mere
sake as anybody whom we could name&mdash;as the Duke of
Roxburghe, Mr. Heber, Mr. Corser, or Mr. Crossley.</p>

<p>In my <i>Rolls of Collectors</i> I specify a type under the
designation of <i>Book-Recipients</i>, and I instance such cases
as Dickens and Thackeray; but in fact there are many
who would never go in pursuit of anything of the kind
beyond a work of reference, and whose utmost exploit
is the payment of a friendly subscription. The only
title to admittance into my category of such doubtful
enthusiasts is the sentimental enhancement of value
arising from the transformation of the margins of a
common-place volume into a repository for manuscript
remarks or graphic embellishments, which may send it
back into the market some day a three-figure item in a
catalogue.</p>

<p>In attempting to indicate in a sort of tentative
manner the publications to which a private collection
might be advantageously and comfortably limited, one
does not contemplate the shelf or so of mere works of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[<a href="./images/91.png">91</a>]</span>
reference, which have to be obtained even by such as
are not amateurs in this direction, and, moreover, there
is an obvious difficulty in prescribing for persons of
infinitely varied ideas and prepossessions. Now, as to
volumes for reference, the class and extent of course
depend on individual requirements, and the books
outside this radius are apt to be subject in their selection
to local circumstances, since a man associated with a
district or county naturally contracts a sympathy with
its special history or its arch&aelig;ological transactions, as
well as any miscellaneous monographs relating to particular
places or celebrated persons. With such specialities
and preferences we cannot presume to interfere;
but, as a rule, the aggregate body comprised in
them need not be large or very expensive, and in catholic
or general literature it becomes almost surprising when
we have taken the pains to winnow from literary remains
of real and permanent interest the preponderant mass,
of which the facilities for occasional examination at a
public library ought to suffice, how comparatively slender
the residuum is.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we inspect a great library, filling three or four
apartments lined with cases, the first impression is that
the possession of such an assemblage of literary monuments
is a privilege reserved for the very wealthy; and
to some extent so it is. But certain elements enter into
the constitution of all extensive accumulations of property
of any kind, whether it be books, prints, medals, or coins,
which inevitably swell the bulk and the cost without
augmenting in anything approaching an equal ratio the
solid value. Not to wander from our immediate field
of inquiry and argument, the literary connoisseur, starting
perhaps with a fairly modest programme, acquires
almost insensibly an inclination to expand and diverge,
until he becomes, instead of the owner of a taste, the
victim of an insatiable passion. He not merely admits
innumerable authors and works of whom or which he
originally knew nothing, but there are variant impressions,
copies with special readings or an unique<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
<i>provenance</i>, bindings curious or splendid; and nothing
at last comes amiss, the means of purchase presumed.</p>

<p>Yet, at the same time, he does not substantially
possess, perhaps, much more than the master of a <i>petite
biblioth&egrave;que</i>, on which the outlay has not been a hundredth
part of his own. A considerable proportion of his shelf-furniture
are distant acquaintances, as it were, and those
acquisitions with which he is intimate are not unlikely
to prove less numerous than the belongings of his
humbler and less voracious contemporary.</p>

<p>Even where the object and ruling law are strict
practical selections of what pleases the buyer, the range
of difference is very wide. One man prefers the modern
novelists, prose essayists, or verse writers; a second, collections
of caricatures and prints in book-form; a third,
topography; a fourth, the occult sciences, and so forth.
I offer no objection to these partialities; but I entertain
an individual preference for volumes chosen from nearly
all branches of the <i>belles lettres</i>, each for its own sake.
I do not vote of necessity in all cases for a book because
it is rare, or because it is old, or because it is the best
edition; but I do not think that I should like any scholar
my friend to have the opportunity of pointing out to
me (as he would, wouldn't he?) that I lacked any real
essential, as the child tried to satisfy Longfellow that
his shelves were not complete without a copy of the
undying romance of Jack the Giant-killer.</p>

<p>It cannot fail to strike any one opening such books as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
Bacon's <i>Sylva Sylvarum</i> or Markham's <i>Way to Get Wealth</i>,
for how comparatively, indeed absolutely, small a consideration
it is possible to obtain two works so brimful of
interest and curiosity on all subjects connected with gardening,
agriculture, and rural pursuits or amusements. But
both these works long remained&mdash;the Bacon yet does so&mdash;outside
the collector's pale and cognisance, and the real
cause was that they were alike common; they had been the
favourites of successive generations; edition upon edition
had been demanded; and the survival of copies was too
great to suit the book-hunter, who aims at shyer quarry.</p>

<p>Take again, as a sample, a noble old work like the
English Bayle, five substantial folios; it was a question
of more than a five-pound note to become the master of a
good, well-bound copy; one in morocco or russia by Roger
Payne twice that amount could once scarcely have brought
down; and now it is <i>articulo mortis</i>. The connoisseur
finds it too bulky, and he hears that its matter has been
superseded. At any rate, it is no longer the <i>mode</i>, and
the mill begins to acquire familiarity with it. Let the
taste return for such big game, and copies will be as Caxtons
are. Most part of the editions will ere then have
been served up again in the form of cheap book-drapery.</p>

<p>The <i>ne plus ultra</i> of interest and respect seems to us
to centre in such collections of books as those of Samuel
Pepys, Narcissus Luttrell, the Rev. Henry White of Lichfield,
and Charles Lamb, where the volumes reflect the
personal tastes of their owners, and are, or have been,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>
objects to them of personal regard. What is to be
thought or said of the man who simply buys works which
happen to be in the fashion for the moment, and for
which he competes with others as wise as himself, till the
prices become ridiculous? English and American millionaires
acquire specimens of early typography, poetry,
binding, or what not, because they hear that it is the
thing to do. One gentleman will give &pound;100 more for a
copy, because he is credibly informed that it is three-eighths
of an inch taller than any other known; and a
second will take something from the vendor on the
assurance that no library of any pretensions is complete
without it. This sort of child's-play is not Book-Collecting.
The true book-closet and its master have to be kinsfolk,
not acquaintances introduced by some bookseller
in waiting. Humanly speaking, the poor little catalogue
made by Hearne of his own books and MSS. comes
nearer home to our affections than those of Grenville
and Huth.</p>

<p>In speaking and thinking of real books, it is necessary
again to distinguish between articulate productions of
two classes&mdash;between such a work, for example, as Defoe's
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and such an one as Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>,
or between Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire</i> and Sir Thomas Browne's <i>Urn-Burial</i>. The present
is an enterprise directed toward the indication to
collectors of different views and tastes of the volumes
which they should respectively select for study or pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>chase.
There are millions who have passed through life
unconsciously without having read a book, although they
may have seen, nay, possessed thousands. Those which
might have been recommended to them with advantage,
and perused with advantage, were too obscure, too dull,
too cheap, too unfashionable. It is of no use to read
publications with which your acquaintances have no
familiarity, and to the merits of which it might be a
hard task to convert them. But, as we have said, we
want space to enter into these details, and we can only
generalise bibliographically, repeating that literature is
broadly classifiable into Books and Things in Book-Form&mdash;Specimens
of Paper, Typography and Binding, or
counterfeit illusory distributions of printer's letter into
words and sentences and volumes by the passing favourites
of each succeeding age&mdash;what Thoreau call its "tit-men."</p>

<p>We might readily instance masterpieces of erudition
or industry which leave nothing to be desired in the way
of information and safe guidance, and which, at the same
time, do not distantly realise our conception of Books&mdash;real
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> Books. They may be the best editions by
the best binders, or they may be antiquarian periodicals
or sets of Learned Transactions, reducing much of the
elder lore cherished and credited by our ancestors to waste-paper;
we feel that it is a sort of superstition which influences
us in regarding them; but we fail to shake off the
prejudice, or whatever it may be, and we hold up, on the
contrary, to the gaze of some sceptical acquaintance a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>
humble little volume in plain mellow sheep&mdash;say, a first
Walton, or Bunyan, or Carew, nay, by possibility a Caxton
or Wynkyn de Worde&mdash;which a roomful of perfectly gentlemanly
books should not buy from us. It may strike the
reader as a heresy in taste and judgment to pronounce
the four Shakespeare folios of secondary interest from the
highest point of view, as being posthumous and edited
productions. But so it is; yet Caxton's first impression of
Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, if we were to happen upon
it by accident, is a possession which we should not be
easily persuaded to coin into sovereigns, and such a prize
as the Evelyn copy of Spenser's <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, 1590,
with the Diarist's cypher down the back and his note of
ownership inside the old calf cover, is worth a library of
inarticulate printed matter. So, again, Aubrey, in his
<i>Miscellanies</i>, <i>Remains of Gentilism and Judaism</i>, <i>History
of Surrey</i>, and <i>Natural History of Wiltshire</i>, presents us
with works very imperfect and empirical in their character&mdash;even
foolish and irritating here and there; but
between those undertakings and such as Manning and
Bray's or Brayley and Britton's <i>Surrey</i> there is the difference
that the latter are literary compilations, and the
former personal relics inalienably identified with an individual
and an epoch.</p>

<p>It is the same with certain others, ancient as well as
modern writers. Take Herodotus, Athen&aelig;us, and Aulus
Gellius on the one hand, and Bishop Kennett's <i>Parochial
Antiquities</i>, White's <i>Selborne</i>, Knox's <i>Ornithological</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span>
<i>Rambles in Sussex</i>, or Lucas's <i>Studies in Nidderdale</i> on
the other. All these equally tell you, not what some
one else saw or thought, but what they saw or thought
themselves, and in a manner which will never cease to
charm.</p>

<p>There are works, again, which, without professing to
entertain for the authors any strong personal regard, we
read and re-peruse, as we admire a fine piece of sculpture
or <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'procelain'">porcelain</ins>, an antique bronze or cameo, as masterpieces
of art or models of style. We are perfectly conscious, as
we proceed, that they are not to be trusted as authorities,
and perhaps it is so on the very account which renders
them irresistibly attractive. Some of the most celebrated
literary compositions in our language are more or less
strongly imbued with the spirit of partisanship or a
leaven of constitutional bias; yet we like to have them
by us to steal half-an-hour's delight, just as we resort
sometimes to alluring but dangerous stimulants. We
have in our mind, not volumes of fiction, not even the
historical novel, but serious narratives purporting to
describe the annals of our country and the lives of our
countrymen and countrywomen. We take them up and
we lay them down with pleasure, and it is agreeable to
feel that they are not far away; and they will not do
us greater harm, if we combine an acquaintance with
their deficiencies and faults as well as with their beauties,
than the fascinating associates with whom we exchange
civilities in the drawing-room or at the club, and with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
whose haunts and opinions we are alike unconcerned. Of
the romances under the soberer names of history, biography,
and criticism, which abound in all the literatures
of nearly all times, we are at liberty to credit as much
or as little as we choose; but in how many instances we
should regret to lose, or not to have inherited, these;
and the personal partiality which constitutes the blemish
here and there equally constitutes the merit.</p>

<p>What makes us return again and again to certain
books in all literatures, forgetful of chronology and biographical
dictionaries? What draws us irresistibly for
the twentieth time to works of such different origin and
character as Herodotus, C&aelig;sar, Aulus Gellius, Browne's
<i>Urn-Burial</i> and <i>Religio Medici</i>, Pepys's <i>Diary</i>, Defoe's
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>, and a handful
of authors nearer to our own day? Is it not their breadth,
catholicism, and sincerity? Is it not precisely those
qualities which no sublunar systems of computing time
can affect or delimit? If we take successively in hand
the <i>Odyssey</i>, the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>,
<i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>Gil Blas de Santillane</i>, and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>,
do we without some reflection realise that between the
first and the last in order of production thousands of years
intervened? Most of the romances of chivalry and the
<i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i> strike us as more antiquated than Homer,
assuredly more so than Chaucer. The secret and the
charm seems to lie in the fact that all great books are
pictures of human nature, which is and has been always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
the same; and we are able to account in a similar
manner for the stupendous popularity of such works as
the <i>Imitatio Christi</i> and the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>. Above
all things, they are strictly <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>. They are no catch-pennies.</p>

<p>We find ourselves with hundreds, nay, thousands of
other books at our elbow or at our command, living in
communion with half-a-dozen minds. We read our
favourite books, and when we have reached the end of our
tether, we recommence as if we were in the Scilly Islands,
and there were no more obtainable or permissible. We
never wax tired of conning over Bayle St. John's <i>Montaigne
the Essayist</i>, Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>, Howell's <i>Venetian
Life</i> and <i>Italian Journeys</i>. <i>Cuique suum.</i> We have
known those who never let the sun set without dipping
into Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, or who have some
pet volume with which they renew their intimacy every
year, as Francis Douce did with <i>Reynard the Fox</i>. There
must usually be an unconscious sympathy in these cases,
a pleasing revelation of extended identity, as if these
other productions were what we should have liked to
claim as our own, and as if we felt we should have said
the same things and thought the same thoughts, if they
had been ours.</p>

<p>It is the same with some parts of some writers'
labours, to be had separately, as <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>As You Like
It</i>, <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, <i>The Merry Wives of
Windsor</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, and the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
with a few detached or select compositions to which
one has to thread one's way in a larger volume: a
few songs scattered through the early dramatists and
lyrists; Gray's <i>Elegy</i>; Tennyson's <i>May Queen</i> (without
the sequel), and <i>Locksley Hall</i> and <i>In Memoriam</i> (missing
the tags).</p>

<p>In the present aspect of our inquiry, <i>Famous Books</i>
and the <i>Best</i> are by no means convertible terms. There
are such, it is true, as fall under both categories: the
Hebrew Scriptures, Homer, Herodotus, <i>Arabian Nights</i>,
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>, Montaigne's <i>Essays</i>, Shakespeare, Gibbon.
Famous literary compositions at different levels or in
their various classes are Boccaccio's <i>Decameron</i>, Ariosto's
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>, Aretino, Spenser's <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, Rabelais,
<i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, La Fontaine's <i>Tales</i>, Rousseau's
<i>Confessions</i>, <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, <i>Candide</i>, <i>Don Juan</i>; and
even among these how fair a proportion depends for
its value and fruitfulness on the student? And, again,
on his training. For we are aware of readers who prefer
Bunyan to Spenser, others who place Sterne, Voltaire,
and Byron before both, and not a few who have emerged
with profit and without pollution from the perusal of
the labours of Rabelais and Aretino. There is a literal
deluge of moral and colourless works, on the contrary,
from which even the average modern reader comes away
only with an uncomfortable sense of waste of time and
eyesight.</p>

<p>Of printed matter in book-shape there is no end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>
The mass grows day by day, almost hour by hour. Yet
the successful candidates for admission to our inner circle
of publications of all ages and countries, which so far
meet on common ground in being provided with a passport
to succeeding times requiring and recognising no
critical <i>vis&egrave;</i>, increase in numbers slowly, O so slowly!
It would be presumptuous and unsafe to attempt to
discount the ultimate verdict on many now popular
names; but it is to be apprehended that, looking at the
much more numerous body of writers, the calls to immortality
will hereafter be in a relatively diminishing ratio.
The influences and agencies by which certain schools of
thought and work are artificially forced to the front
are too often temporary, and their life is apt to be,
Hamadryad-like, conterminous with that of their foster-parents.
It has been my lot to witness the rise, decline,
and evanescence of groups of authors and artists, whom
it was almost sacrilegious to mention even with qualification.
Adverse criticism was out of the question for any
one valuing his own repute.</p>

<p>How various all the afore-mentioned standard or
permanent books are, and still in one respect how similar!
Similar, inasmuch as they or their subject-matter are
surrounded by an atmosphere which preserves them as
in embalmed cerements. In strict truth, there may be
some among the number which are far indeed from being
individually important or costly, while others in a critical
sense have long been entirely obsolete, or perhaps never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<a href="./images/103.png">103</a>]</span>
possessed any critical rank. It does not signify. Their
testimonials are independent of such considerations.
Many, most of them, are on ever-living topics; many,
again, in their essence and material properties are sanctified
and odorous.</p>

<p>I find myself possessed by a theory, possibly a weak
and erroneous one, in favour of such a book, for instance,
as Johnson's <i>Lives of the Poets</i>, as Johnson published it,
with all its imperfections, with the full consciousness that
improved editions exist. For the original output represents
a genuine aspect of the author's mind, prejudices
inclusive; and I am not sure that, had he lived to bring
out a revised and enlarged impression, I should have
looked upon it as so characteristic and spontaneous; and
the same criticism applies to a number of other productions,
dependent for their appreciation by us not upon
their substantial, so much as on their sentimental, value.</p>

<p>What is not unapt to strike an average mind is that,
with such a caseful of volumes as my cursory and incomplete
inventory represents and enumerates, how much,
or perhaps rather how little, remains behind of solid,
intrinsic worth, and what a preponderance of the unnamed
printed matter resolves itself into <i>bric-&agrave;-brac</i>, unless it
amounts to such publications, past and present, as one
is content to procure on loan from the circulating library
or inspect in the show-cases of our museums.</p>

<p>Happy the men who lived before literary societies,
book-clubs, and cheap editions, which have between them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>
so multiplied the aggregate stock or material from which
the collector has to make his choice! There are occasional
instances where co-operation is useful, and even
necessary; but the movement has perhaps been carried
too far, as such movements usually are. Our forefathers
could not have divined what an unknown future was to
yield to us in the form of printed matter of all sorts
and degrees. But they already had their great authors,
their favourite books, their rarities, in sufficient abundance.
It was a narrower field, but a less perplexing one;
and from the seeing-point of the amateur, pure and
simple, our gain is not unequivocal.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to draw up an experimental
catalogue of works which appear to possess a solid and
permanent claim to respect and attention for their own
sakes, apart from any critical, textual, or other secondary
elements. Others without number might be added as
examples of learning, utility, and curiosity; but they
do not fall within this exceedingly select category:&mdash;</p>

<p>How passing rich one would be with all these, and no
more&mdash;rich beyond the greatest bibliomaniacs, and beyond
the possessors of the rarest and costliest treasures in
book-form! Turn over the pages of the most splendid
catalogues, and how few one would find to add! Nor
would all the before-recited productions appeal to all
book-lovers. There are many who would excuse themselves
from admitting Rabelais. Some might not particularly
care for the works of foreign origin. Some might be
courageous enough to avow an indifference to Milton and
Spenser, and even a dislike to Bunyan. Still the rule
holds good, we think, that all our chosen authors or
books have more or less powerful credentials. There
remain to be added Books of Reference, as we have
pointed out, curiosities, and this or that person's specialisms.</p>

<p>From a strictly practical point of view, the language
and sense of any great writer, ancient or modern, may
be as well, nay, better, appreciated in a volume bought
for a trifle than in a rare and luxurious edition, where
the place and time of origin, the type, the paper, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>
the binding are adventitious accessories&mdash;almost <i>impedimenta</i>&mdash;and
the book itself a work of art like a picture
or a coin. But with either of the latter it is different,
for there the canvas or the metal is an integral portion
of the object. For instance, take the better parts of
Tennyson. Is it not sufficient to read them in a modest
foolscap octavo? Do we require external aids? The
poet is his own best illustrator, and if we purchase a
pictorial edition, we are apt to find that the author and
the artist are at variance in their interpretations.</p>

<p>Translations are always to be carefully avoided by
all who can more or less confidently read the author
in the original language. We have yet to meet with a
version, whether of an ancient or of a modern classic,
which is thoroughly appreciative and satisfactory. The
majority are utterly disappointing and deceptive. It
is in the transfer of the idiom and costume that the
difficulty and consequent failure lie. No one who merely
knows at second hand Homer, Herodotus, Plautus, Terence,
Horace, Virgil, Montaigne, Le Sage (a metonym
for <i>Gil Blas</i>), Cervantes, La Fontaine, Dumas, Maupassant,
Balzac, can have had an opportunity of forming
an adequate and just estimate of those authors.
You might nearly as soon expect a Frenchman to relish
Butler or Dickens in their Parisian habiliments.</p>

<p>Such a fact&mdash;for a fact it undoubtedly is&mdash;opens to
our consideration a very large and a very grave problem,
since the very limited extent to which the English public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
is conversant with Greek and Latin, and with even the
Latin family of modern languages, makes the admission
that so many works of the highest importance and interest
are only properly and truly readable in their own
tongues tantamount to one that they are not properly
and truly readable at all.</p>

<p>Of all forms of translation, the paraphrase is perhaps
the worst, so far as an interpretation of the original
sense goes, but not the most dangerous if we know it
to be what it is, and do not look for more than a general
idea of the meaning and plan of the author. To be
practically serviceable, an English version of any classical
or foreign work should be literal, and with the literalness
as idiomatic as may be; and if the text to be rendered
is in verse, the English equivalent should preferably be
in verse without rhyme or in prose. The object to be
attained in these cases is a transfer of the conceptions,
notions, or theories of writers from languages which we
do not understand to one which we do; and therefore
the best translator is he who has absolutely no higher
aim than this, and does not aspire to make his task a
stalking-horse for his own literary ambition.</p>

<p>There is scarcely an end of the various schemes adopted
to convey to us intelligibly and successfully the sentiments
and conceits of ancient authors as well as of those
of other countries, and, all things considered, a <i>literal</i>
version in prose appears to present the fewest disadvantages,
for it disarms the translator of the temptation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span>
to poetical flights and metrical ingenuity, and brings us
nearer to the man and the age to be immediately and
primarily studied.</p>

<p>At best, a translation is an indifferent substitute for
the book itself, as it was delivered to the world by some
renowned hand, or even by some personage whose individuality
is stamped, as in the case of the <i>Imitatio
Christi</i> or the <i>Essays</i> of Montaigne, on every sentence
indelibly and untransferably, and seems part of the very
Latin or French type. An amusing instance occurred
in which a gentleman, having heard of the fine style of
A Kempis, bought as a present to a friend a copy of the
latest English translation! And it is equally futile to
look for the essence and spirit of the great Gascon
writer in the pages of Florio or Cotton, both of whom,
though in unequal measure, to the exigencies of diction or
an imperfect conversance with the dialect in which Montaigne
wrote sacrificed precious personal idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>The majority of the popular and current versions of
the classics are unsatisfying and treacherous, because they
have been executed either by under-paid scholars, like
Bohn's Series, or by persons who have had a tendency to
put themselves in the place of their author.</p>

<p>We may not be very willing to part with our old
favourites, such as Chapman's <i>Homer</i>, Florio's <i>Montaigne</i>,
North's <i>Plutarch</i>, Shelton's <i>Don Quixote</i>, Urquhart's
<i>Rabelais</i>, and Smollett's <i>Gil Blas</i>; but it is to be feared
that they must be prized as curiosities and rarities rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
than as interpreters and guides. If a thoroughly reliable
library of classical translations, on as literal a plan as
possible, could be formed, it would be a real boon to the
public&mdash;it would be what Bohn's Series ought to have
been. Of course, in the department of translation there
are two leading divisions&mdash;the ancient and the modern
classics; and for much the same reason that a story or
a <i>jeu d'esprit</i> seldom bears transplanting from one soil to
another, both these branches of literature are apt to
suffer when they change their garb. Almost every man
who writes is influenced by dominant environments,
whether he be Greek or Roman, or Oriental, or modern
European of whatever nationality; and his mere expressions
or sense rendered into a foreign tongue are usually
like a painting without a background or an atmosphere.
We may range over the whole field from the most ancient
times to the most modern, and the same thing manifests
itself. Open before me is an illustration which
will answer the purpose as well as any other, in the
shape of Muirhead's version of the <i>Vaux de Vire</i> of
Jean le Houx. At page 105 we have the following
stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Lorsque me presse l'heure,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Je retourne au logis;</p>
<p class="ihalf">Ma femme est la qui pleure,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Ainsi qu'il m'est aduis,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Et me dict en cholere:</p>
<p class="ihalf">'Que fay ie seule au lict?</p>
<p class="ihalf">Est il seant de boire</p>
<p class="ihalf">Ainsi jusqu'&agrave; minuict?'"</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>Mr. Muirhead translates thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"When late the hour appears,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Returning to my home,</p>
<p class="ihalf">My wife is there in tears,</p>
<p class="ihalf">As I hear when I come.</p>
<p class="ihalf">She greets me testily:</p>
<p class="ihalf">'I lie a-bed alone:</p>
<p class="ihalf">Do you thus shamelessly</p>
<p class="ihalf">Carouse till midnight's gone?'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The same kind of paraphrastic dilution runs through
the volume; nor is Mr. Muirhead wholly to blame. The
original is idiomatic and terse, and he could not find
exact equivalents in numerous cases. <i>Ab uno disce omnes.</i>
But what a privilege it becomes to be able to dispense
with interpreters! My admiration of these festive
<i>chansons</i> arises from my appreciation of them in their
native costume and diction. The Knight of La Mancha
was of my opinion herein, for he likened a translation
to a piece of Flemish tapestry seen on the wrong side.</p>

<p>A corollary which naturally suggests itself to my
mind is that if a familiarity&mdash;say, even with Latin and
French alone&mdash;is expedient on no other account, it is
eminently so on this one; and the mastery of the inner
sense of a great and famous writer constitutes an ample
reward for any expenditure of labour and time in acquiring
the language in which he wrote, in making
yourself as nearly his countryman as you can. I remember
a saying, which may have been a wicked epigram, that
the only book in Bohn's Classical Library worthy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
purchase or perusal was a version of one of Aristotle's
works which a gentleman had executed <i>con amore</i> and
presented to the publisher.</p>

<p>A voluminous and not very well known body of
literary material consists of foreign translations of contemporary
English pamphlets of a historical or religious
character, from the time of Henry VIII. to the Revolution
of 1688, covering the entire Stuart period. They cannot
be said to be of primary consequence beyond the proof
which they furnish of the interest felt abroad in passing
transactions in this country, even in such incidents of
minor moment as the trial of Elizabeth Cellier in 1680
for an obscure political libel, and the occasional value
which they have acquired through the apparent loss
of the English originals. We have, for example, a
French account of a London ferryman, who, under pretence
of conveying passengers across the river, strangled
them (1586); a second, of the misdoings of a minister
at Malden in Essex (1588); and a third, of the execution
of two priests and two laymen at Oxford in 1590, the
last existing also in Italian, but none of them known
in English.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Looking</span> at the imperfect and unconsecutive condition
in which much of our most precious early literature has
been received by us, we are apt to reflect to how narrow
and close an accident we owe two classes of existing
remains: the unique book and the unique fragment.
Of course to term a volume or production unique is a
perilous business; the bookseller and the auctioneer may
do so <i>ex officio</i>; an inexperienced amateur may resort
to the term as a pleasant and harmless self-deception;
but no responsible writer or critic dares to pronounce
anything whatever unique without an emphatic <i>caveat</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>
We have personally known cases where a publication
by one of the early printers was first introduced to notice,
and created a sort of sensation, as a mutilated fragment
rescued from the binding of another work; this revelation
brought to light, after an interval, a second of a different
issue; anon at some auction occurred a perfect copy;
and now the poor damaged worm-eaten leaves, once so
reverently and so tenderly regarded, awake no further
interest; the mystery and romance have vanished; and
when we examine the book as a whole, we do not find
its merits so striking as when we strained our eyes to
decipher the old binder's pasteboard.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fragment</span> is really an unusually and more than
at first credibly important feature in the elder literature.
It may be taken, after all deductions for occasional discoveries
of the entire work, to be the sole existing voucher
for a terribly large section of the more popular books of
our forefathers, just as the Stationers' Register is for
another. But it is far more than one degree trustworthier
and more palpable; for it is, like the <i>torso</i> of
an ancient statue, a veritable part of the printed <i>integer</i>
and a certificate of its publication and former existence.
Many years ago there was a great stir in consequence
of the detachment from the binding of another book&mdash;Caxton's
<i>Boethius</i>&mdash;in the St. Alban's Grammar-School
of a parcel of fragments belonging to books by Caxton;
these are now in the British Museum. In the Huth
Catalogue are noticed several relics of a similar kind;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
and indeed scarcely any great library, public or private,
is without them. They may be accepted as provisional
evidences. A rather curious circumstance seems to be
associated with one of the Huth fragments&mdash;three leaves
of Thomas Howell's <i>New Sonnets and Pretty Pamphlets</i>.
The relic once belonged to Thomas Martin of Palgrave,
and includes two leaves of signature D, which are deficient
in the Capell copy of this work at Cambridge. The latter
is described as a quarto; but it would be interesting to
discover that from the fragment the text could be completed.
The inconvenience attending the examination of
rare books in provincial libraries is very great and serious.</p>

printed at Rouen about 1491, and bound in England,
had as flyleaves two sheets of Caxton's <i>Chronicles of
England</i>, possibly some of the waste found in Caxton's
warehouse after his death.</p>

<p>There is a weird fascination about a newly found
fragment of some lost literary composition. Only a few
months since, in a copy of Cicero's <i>Rhetorica</i>, printed
by Aldus Manutius in 1546, in the possession of Mr.
Neal, quite a number of pieces of wastrel were disclosed
on the removal of the covers, and among them portions
of English metrical effusions of the period (for the volume
must have been bound here). We view this <i>treasure trove</i>
wistfully and indulgently; there it is; no mortal eye
had fallen on it in the course of three and a half
centuries; and how can we be expected to judge its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
value or quality by the ordinary standard&mdash;on an
ordinary critical principle? It has come to us like an
unlooked-for testamentary windfall. We are not to look
at it in the mouth too curiously or fastidiously, or we
deserve to have lost it; and it is the very same thing
with scores of remains of the kind, brought to light in
various directions and ways from season to season, and
(to the utmost extent of my power and opportunity)
chronicled by me on my accustomed principle.</p>

<p>When I was younger by some thirty years, I received
the catalogue of a provincial bookseller, and was sanguine
enough to suppose that I should become the happy
master at the marked price (7s. 6d.) of No. 2084, which
ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Pynson and others&mdash;Specimens of Early Printing, comprising
<i>Twenty Leaves of the Ballad of Robin Hood, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i>, taken from the
cover of an old Missal."</p></div>

<p>No time was lost in giving the order; <i>but the lot was
sold, and the proprietors did not even know who had bought
it</i>. I comforted myself as the fox did. Yet such is the
frailty of one's nature, that one cannot refrain, after long,
long years, from sentimentalising over it. There is something
so taking in the notion of a tattered, semi-illegible,
unappropriated fractional relic, not a trunk even; it
fascinates us like a coin of which the legend is almost
beyond identification; there is mystery behind it; we
may be on the track of a discovery which will help to
make us famous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>
We have all heard of the <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i>,
rescued by Mr. Conybeare in the early years of the
century from another book, of which the fragments
assisted to form the covers, and how the treasure was
prized till a complete copy occurred in a Continental
library and dispelled the charm. It was pointed out many
years ago by the present writer (<i>Old English Jest-Books</i>,
1864, i., Additional Notes) that Scot, in his <i>Discovery of
Witchcraft</i>, 1584, quotes the story from this miscellany of
the miller's eels, and enabled us, before the G&ouml;ttingen copy
was brought under notice, to complete the text, which is
almost undecipherable in the Conybeare (now Huth) one.</p>

<p>The fragmentary state by no means restricts itself to
literary items of insignificant bulk. For, as we see, a
potential factor in the creation of rare books has been a
vast temporary popularity, succeeded by a prolonged
period of neglect. The result is before us in the almost
total evanescence of thousands of books extending to
hundreds of pages. Look at Blind Harry's <i>Wallace</i>, a
large volume, first printed in folio about 1520; a few
leaves are all that remain of the <i>editio princeps</i>; and
others have totally vanished. Many of us are familiar
with the tolerably ample dimensions of the service-books
of various uses in the English Church; and yet those of
Aberdeen, Hereford, and York survive only in fragments
or <i>torsi</i>; and the modern reprint of the first was formed
from a combination of several imperfect originals. A similar
fate has all but overtaken such excessively popular works as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>
Coverdale's Bible, 1535, and Fox's <i>Martyrs</i>, 1563, an absolutely
perfect copy of either of which I have never beheld.</p>

<p>Henry Oxinden, of Barham in Kent, was the earliest
recorded collector of old English plays, and bound up his
122 dramatic possessions in six volumes before 1647. He
has left a list of them in his manuscript common-place
book. Tears almost steal into our eyes as we read the
titles: the <i>Hamlet</i> of 1603, the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>,
1594, <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>. Of the first we know well
enough the history to date: two copies, both imperfect.
The second exists in the unique Inglis, Heber, and Devonshire
example; it is mentioned in Longman's Catalogue
for 1817, from which it was purchased by Rodd, and sold
to Mr. Inglis; it is reputed to have once belonged to
Pope. The remaining item survives in the titleless copy
at present in the library of Eton College, to which Mr.
Briggs presented it in 1818, not on account of the association
of Udall the author with that seminary of learning,
but, curiously enough, by mere accident.</p>

<p>Among Bagford's collections there is a single leaf of
an otherwise unknown impression of Clement Robinson's
<i>Handful of Pleasant Delights</i>, a 1565 book only hitherto
extant in a 1584 reprint. This precious little <i>mor&ccedil;eau</i>
altogether differs, so far as it goes, from the corresponding
portion of the volume now preserved in the National
Library.</p>

<p>Let me insist a little on the instructive progress of
knowledge in one or two cases. A fragment of a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[<a href="./images/121.png">121</a>]</span>
tract in verse by Lydgate, from the prolific press of
Wynkyn de Worde, was proclaimed as an extraordinary
and unique accession to our literary stores some eighty
years since; it was called <i>The Treatise of a Gallant</i>, and
had been taken from the covers of a volume of statutes
in the library at Nash Court. Some time after, a
complete copy of another impression turned up, and
ultimately a third, quite distinct from either of the
previous two, was discovered in a volume of marvellously
rare pieces sold by a Bristol bookseller to the late Mr.
Maskell for &pound;300, and by him to the British Museum.
Take another case connected with the same press. A
piece entitled <i>The Remorse of Conscience</i>, by William
Lichfield, parson of All Hallows, Thames Street, who
died in 1447, leaving a larger number of MSS. behind
him than Lamb once humorously made Coleridge do,
long enjoyed the reputation of being a solitary survivor;
but at present the world holds four, two recovered from
bindings, and a third titleless, and all, in fact, more or
less dilapidated by unappreciative or over-appreciative
handlers. Last, not least, the delightful idyll of <i>Adam
Bell</i>, of which we were so glad on a time to follow the
Garrick exemplar, is now proved to have been in type in
the reign of Henry VIII.; and a piece of a pre-Reformation
issue luckily preserves enough to show how, even in
a production probably sold at a penny, it was thought
worth while to alter a passage where the Pope was
originally alluded to.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span>
There are instances where we are deprived of the
gratification of beholding so much as a morsel of a
book sufficient to establish its former existence in hundreds,
if not thousands, of copies. Of the <i>Four Sons of
Aymon</i>, from the press of Wynkyn de Worde, 1504,
not a vestige has so far accrued; yet it once existed,
as it is expressly cited in a later issue. So it is,
again, with Skelton's <i>Nigramansir</i>, printed by De
Worde in 1504, which was actually seen by Weston
the historian in the hands of Collins the poet, and
with <i>Peter Fabyl's Ghost</i> (the Merry Devil of Edmonton)
from the same press.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to associate with the black-letter
fragment the name of <span class="smcap">John Bagford</span>, who, in the
closing years of the seventeenth and beginning of the
next century, distinguished himself by the zeal with which
he collected typographical specimens and memorials. In
Bagford's day, the relative value of old books was scarcely
at all understood; there was no adequate discrimination
between the productions of Caxton and his immediate
successors and those of living or recent printers; and,
again, which was more excusable, volumes by early divines
or by writers of established repute were more generally
sought than those by schools of poetry and fiction, which
at present command chief attention and respect. If we
turn over the pages of an auctioneer's catalogue belonging
to that era, we perceive, side by side, items estimated at
about the same figure, of which many have become worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[<a href="./images/123.png">123</a>]</span>
perhaps even less, while a few have left their former companions
immeasurably behind, and one or two rank among
the <i>livres introuvables</i>. Those were the days when the
classics were preserved with the most jealous care, and
acquired at extravagant prices, and when our vernacular
literature, from the introduction of typography down to the
Restoration, was an object of attention to an extremely
limited constituency, and could be obtained for a song.</p>

<p>The Bagford collection of title-pages and fragments
formerly constituted part of the Harleian manuscripts in
the British Museum, but has been chiefly transferred to
the printed book department of recent years. It resembles
a Typographical Cemetery, a charnel-house of books
crowded together without respect to their subject-matter
or their literary rank: the leaf of a Caxton, another of
a valueless legal treatise, the title-page of <i>Romeus and
Julietta</i>, on which Shakespeare founded, as the phrase goes,
his own play, and a broadsheet preserved entire, there being
no more of it. But Bagford, who helped Dr. Moore,
Bishop of Ely, and perchance Lord Oxford, to some of
their rarities, does not stand alone. He had many
followers; but the scale of operations diminished as the
orthodox collector multiplied and prices rose. Sir John
Fenn, editor of the <i>Paston Letters</i>, whom we have named
above, was a disciple, however, and Martin of Palgrave was
another. Many years since, for a proposed new <i>Biographia
Britannica</i> by Murray of Albemarle Street, the present
writer collected all the known particulars of Bagford him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>self,
who spent his last days in the Charterhouse. His
episcopal client or patron died in 1714.</p>

<p>Before we condemn these biblioclasts, let us recollect
one thing. It is not so much that they have rendered
books imperfect by the abstraction of leaves or title-pages,
as that they have actually preserved the sole testimony
for the existence of hundreds of books, tracts, and broadsheets
of which we should have otherwise known nothing,
amid the wholesale destruction of early literature, which
was not arrested till the close of the last century, and
still proceeds in a modified form and degree. Not many
years since the <i>Troy-Book</i> printed by Caxton was discovered
hanging up in a water-closet at Harrogate; a
portion had disappeared, but the remainder was secured,
and was sold to a dealer in Manchester for thirty guineas.
It must be, and is, Bagford's apology that he sacrificed
to his typographical scheme material which was almost
universally neglected, and for which there might seem,
two hundred years ago, scarcely any prospect of a future
call. Yet, oddly enough, this very person was one of the
pioneers, by his labours and example, in bringing back a
taste for the older English school; he appeared at a
juncture when sufficient time had elapsed for the destruction
by various agencies of a vast proportion of the
products of the press; but until the fashion, which he and
others set, had begun to spread, it remained unknown
how much was reduced from its original volume, and how
much had perished. We have the less pretence for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>
censuring the biblioclasts of the past, who could only use
the eyes and experience of their own epoch, when instances
are reported from time to time of the same ruthless
practices even by those who might have been expected to
know better; and there is more than one way of viewing
the present notorious tendency to exterminate the old
theology on the plea that it is worthless, since a generation
may arise which will upbraid us for having converted to
pulp this part of our inheritance, till it comes at last to
survive in a stray leaf here or a mangled fragment there.
An altogether different quarter from which a result conducive
to the shrinkage or disappearance of copies of
early works has arisen is the print-collecting movement,
involving the devastation of the innumerable volumes
which contain portraits, frontispieces, and other engravings,
and the more than incidental risk of the consignment of
the unvalued residue to the waste-basket; and it may be
mentioned that within our personal knowledge hundreds
upon hundreds of scarce old books have been destroyed by
editors, lexicographers, and other literary workers, to save
the trouble of transcribing extracts. It might be impossible
to exhaust the variety of ways in which an extraordinarily
large body of publications of former days has been reduced
or raised to the position of rarities of graduated rank.</p>

<p>After all these ages, all the indefatigable researches
which have been undertaken for profit or for pleasure, all
the libraries which have been formed and dispersed, true
it is that the Unique volume, which of course enjoys its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>
designation only till a second copy is producible, still
survives in such abundance, that one, if it were otherwise
feasible, might form a library composed of nothing else.
Does it not become curious to consider to what lottery, as
it were, we owe them&mdash;owe their arrest just at the dividing
line between living and lost literature? Whatever may be
the cause, we have hitherto failed to trace duplicates of the
metrical <i>Ship of Fools</i>, 1509, <i>Queen Elizabeth's Prayer-Book</i>,
1569, Watson's <i>Teares of Fancie</i>, 1593, <i>Venus and
Adonis</i>, 1593, 1599, and 1617, and of <i>Lucrece</i>, 1598.
Copies of these later productions must have found their
way to Shakespeare's country at the time. Malone met
with the <i>Venus and Adonis</i> of 1593 at Manchester in 1805,
and another collector with that of 1594 in the same shire;
and the Florio's <i>Montaigne</i> of 1603, the only volume with
the poet's autograph yet seen, was long preserved at
Smethwick, near Birmingham. It was at Manchester, too,
that the copy of the <i>Tragedy of Richard III.</i>, 1594,
came to light as recently as 1881. Several of the works
of Nicholas Breton and Samuel Rowlands survive in isolated
copies. Upwards of a century has elapsed since a
medical man picked up in Ayrshire in 1788 an assemblage
of quarto tracts belonging to the ancient vernacular
literature of Scotland and to the parent press of Edinburgh;
and not a whisper has been raised to suggest the
existence of a second copy of any of them, which is to be
regretted so far, as some are imperfect. During years
on years, the authorities at the Advocates' Library,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
Edinburgh, kept this inestimable relic in a cupboard
under the stairs. In the find at Lamport Hall,
Northamptonshire, thirty or forty years since, there were
items upon items utterly unknown. It was the same at
the Wolfreston sale in 1856. It goes without saying that
among the Heber stores the uniques were barely numerable;
and many yet preserve their reputation as such. Mr.
Caldecott, Mr. Jolley, and Mr. Corser were lucky in
falling in with scores of tracts of the first order of
rarity. No one has beheld the double of the <i>Jests of the
Widow Edith</i>, purchased by Lord Fitzwilliam for &pound;3 10s.
at West's sale in 1773, and formerly Lord Oxford's; and
the citation of the last name prompts the remark that
many a book in the Harleian Library still awaits recovery,
assuming the description in the catalogue to be
correct. On the contrary, there are serious warnings to
enthusiasts not to rely too implicitly on the reputation of
a volume for uniqueness or high rarity in view of such
phenomena as the occurrence within a short period of
each other at the same mart in 1896 of two copies of the
first edition of Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, printed by
Caxton. Here was a case where the publicity afforded
to these matters brought out a second example, which
the owner found to be worth a small estate.</p>

<p>The writer's publication, <i>Fugitive Tracts</i>, 1493-1700,
2 vols., 1875, very aptly and powerfully illustrates the
present bearings of our subject. Of the sixty pieces there
reproduced, two-thirds appear to be unique, and only four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
are traceable in the Heber Catalogue. Yet many of the
items are of historical or biographical importance, and
were, in fact, selected from a much larger number with
that view; which seems to be tantamount to a recognition
of the truth, that, enormous as is the total surviving body
of early English and Scotish Literature, it represents in
some sections or classes only a salvage of what was once in
type, or, to speak more by the card, of what we have so
far been able to recover.</p>

<p>There are rare books which, paradoxical as it may
seem, are not rare. Take, for example, Burton's <i>Anatomy
of Melancholy</i>, 1621; the first folio Shakespeare, 1623;
Milton's <i>Lycidas</i>, <i>Poems</i>, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, <i>Paradise Regained</i>,
in the <i>editiones principes</i>; the works of the minor poets,
Suckling, Carew, Shirley, Davenant; Walton's <i>Angler</i>,
1653; Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, 1678; the Kilmarnock
Burns, 1786; and many first editions of Wordsworth,
Lamb, Shelley, Keats, Tennyson. Every season swells
the roll of existing copies. On the contrary, Spenser's
<i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, Books i.-iii., 1590, and Milton's <i>Comus</i>,
1634, are authentically scarce, the former especially so
in fine state; and the same may be predicated of Lovelace's
<i>Lucasta</i> (the two parts complete). But the real meaning of
the rarity of the other books above specified&mdash;and the list
might be readily enlarged&mdash;is that, although the copies are
numerous enough, the taste for capital productions has
increased within a few years out of proportion to the
recovery of new or unknown examples.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>
We are finding frequent occasion to cite works of
foreign origin, which are more or less habitually taken
up into our own collections by miscellaneous or general
buyers; and there is among these one which forms a
signal illustration of the fallacy of uniqueness. It is the
Gutenberg or Mazarin Bible. Scarcely a library of the
first rank occurs here or elsewhere without offering a
copy; and we are persuaded that at least forty must
exist, either on paper or on vellum, throughout the world.
The book occupies the same bibliographical position as
the first folio Shakespeare, the first edition of Walton's
<i>Angler</i>, and the first Burns; it tends to grow commoner,
yet, so far, not cheaper.</p>

<p>There are other books which, as it may be more readily
understood, are rare without being valuable, and of which
such of the commercial world as has it not in its power
to expend large amounts on individual purchases, naturally
seeks to make the most. It was almost amusing, some
time since, to note the entries in some of the booksellers'
lists under "Black Letter," "Gothic Letter," "Rare Law,"
"Curious Early English," and so forth; and the names
of Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, and other ancient printers
were freely introduced to help off a rather lame foreigner,
who was alleged to have been professionally associated
with one or the other of them. If the bookseller knows
the book-buyer, it is highly requisite that the latter
should study what he is going to buy.</p>

<p>Illustrations are not wanting of the loss of untold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[<a href="./images/130.png">130</a>]</span>
treasure through a medium more fatal than any other&mdash;through
exhaustive popular demand. Entire and large
impressions of books, pamphlets, and broadsides have
succumbed, not to the sacrilegious hand of the spoiler,
but to the too affectionate, and not too cleanly,
fingering of the multitude of men and women who read
and then cast the sources of entertainment away. If we
remember that certain of the Bibles ordered to be
kept in churches for general use chiefly survive in crumbling
fragments, or at best woefully dilapidated copies,
we cease to be surprised at the easy prey which more
fugitive compositions have formed to a succession of careless
and indifferent owners. The illiterate inscriptions
on many books, which have thus become valuable, point
to the hands through which they have passed, and tell
a story of prolonged neglect, too often culminating in
appropriation to domestic requirements.</p>

<p>It is, anyhow, perfectly undeniable that of the miscellaneous
early literature of all countries, the proportion
which exists is in very numerous instances no more than
a simple voucher for the work having passed the press.
A single copy has formerly occurred or occurs fortuitously,
and no duplicate can be cited. This is the position of
thousands of volumes, and of many it is the chief merit.</p>

<p>Infinitely numerous are the strange tales, sometimes
drawing up the moisture into the mouth, sometimes
sufficient to make one's hair rigid, of books of price hung
up for use at country railway stations, or employed by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[<a href="./images/131.png">131</a>]</span>
tobacconist to wrap up his pennyworths of snuff, or
converted by a lady of quality into curl-papers. What
has become of the Caxtons sent over to the Netherlands
in the last century by a confiding English gentleman
their owner, for the inspection of a nameless Mynheer his
friend, who, when he was invited to restore them, lamented
their disappearance in a fire?</p>

<p>There was beyond a question an epoch, and a prolonged
one, when the mill shared with household demands
an immense quota of the cast-off literature of these
islands. One of our early collectors of Caxtons, Ratcliff,
whose books were sold in 1776, acquired his taste (one
in a thousand) through his vocation as a chandler or
storekeeper in the Borough. We may surmise how his
Caxtons came to him, and at what rates!</p>

<p>These episodes appertain to the romantic and speculative
aspect of book-collecting; but they really have
another side. Here, at a time when the first-fruits of
the English press were unregarded, we find a man of
Ratcliff's status acquiring thirty Caxtons. He lived just
to see a rise in their value, yet a very slight and
fluctuating one; for at last he went into the open market
and purchased a few lots at West's auction in 1773, and
the Caxtons thus obtained re-sold after Ratcliff's death
in one or two cases at a lower rate. He had inflated
the market; the competitors were not more than two
or three. But the time was soon to come when such
persons could no longer afford to hold this kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>
property&mdash;when it became fashionable for dukes and earls
and men of large property to make our early typography
an object of research; and so it continued down to the
present time, till the agricultural depression arrived to
create another organic change, and to direct these, as
well as other costly luxuries, into new channels. Not the
chandler, or the Government official, or the private gentleman
of modest means, but the great manufacturer or the
merchant-prince entered on the scene, and wrested from
the landowner his long-cherished possessions. The West
and Ratcliff sales (1773-76) were the two golden opportunities,
however, of which the advisers of George III.
wisely availed themselves to purchase volumes at what
we have been taught to consider nominal prices; and
there they are in the British Museum to-day, a recollection
of one of the better traits in the character of that
prince. When we say that the market for Caxtons in
1776 was beginning to expand, we mean that the day
for getting such things for a few pence or a shilling or
two had gone by. Here, for example, are some of the
quotations from the Ratcliff auction:&mdash;</p>

auction, 1773, appear by comparison rather extravagant.
For his Majesty's agent at the latter gave as much as
&pound;14 for the romance of <i>Paris and Vienne</i>, from the
Caxton press, 1485. True, it seems to be unique, and
might to-day require its purchaser, if it were for sale, to
have &pound;500 in his pocket or at his bank to secure it.
Yet strange events still continue to happen from time
to time. Not Caxtons nor Shakespeares, but excellent
books which command prices in the open market, are
yet occasionally given away.</p>

<p>A case occurred in Lincolnshire about a year ago,
when a library of some 2500 volumes was sold by an
intelligent provincial auctioneer <i>al fresco</i> in the dogdays,
and put up in bundles, nearly all of which were knocked
down at the first bid&mdash;<i>threepence</i>. Say, 150 lots at 3d.
per lot = &pound;1 17s. 6d. for the whole. There must have
been an <i>entente cordiale</i> among those in attendance, the
gentleman in the rostrum inclusive.</p>

<p>These instances of misdirection, which have been in
times past more numerous than now, although two of
the most recent and most signal have occurred in the
same county (Lincolnshire), inevitably tend to the destruction
of copies, and so far illustrate our remarks on
the causes of the gradual disappearance of books during
former periods.</p>

<p>There are, however, circumstances under which prices
are depressed by collusion, as where a first folio Shakespeare
was knocked done for &pound;20 in an auction-room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[<a href="./images/134.png">134</a>]</span>
not five hundred miles from Fleet Street; or by an accident,
as when the original <i>Somers Tracts</i>, in thirty folio
volumes, comprising unique <i>Americana</i>, fetched <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>
under the hammer only &pound;61. A single item was re-sold
for sixty guineas, and would now bring thrice that
amount. What a game of chance this book traffic is!</p>

<p>Imperfect Books, as distinguished from Fragments,
constitute a rather complex and troublesome portion
and aspect of collecting. They are susceptible of classification
into books&mdash;(1) Of which no perfect copy is
known; (2) Of which none is known outside one or two
great libraries; (3) Of which even imperfect examples,
as of a specimen of early typography or of engraving,
are valuable and interesting; (4) Of which copies are
more or less easily procurable. It is only the last division
at which an amateur of any pretensions and resources
draws the line. With the other contingencies our keenest
and richest book-hunters and our most important public
collections have been and are obliged to be satisfied.
When it is a question of a unique, or almost unique,
Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, or Pynson, or quite as
much of a volume from the London, St. Albans, Tavistock,
York, or Edinburgh presses, what is to be done?
The object, no doubt, <i>laisse &agrave; desirer</i>; but where is
another? This sentiment and spirit operated twice, as
we have elsewhere noted, within three months in 1896
in the case of two incomplete copies of the first edition
by Caxton of Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. But for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>
defective copy of a common book some find an apology
and a home: they cannot afford a better, or they require
it for a special purpose. The upshot is, that for every
old volume there is a customer, who is pleased with his
acquisition according to his light; and we have met with
such as seemed disposed to view the missing of damaged
leaves as negative evidence of antiquity and genuineness.</p>

<p>The bystander who has had the benefit of as long
an innings as the present writer, witnesses perpetual
changes and vicissitudes of sentiment; and from one
point of view, at all events, the minute details, into
which the too generally despised bibliographer enters,
are valuable, because they present to us, in lists of
editions of authors and books published from age to age,
the astonishing evidence of mutable popularity or acceptability.
There is a feature, which is almost amusing, in
the ideas and estimates expressed of many works by our
earlier antiquaries, when we look to-day at their position
and rank. If we turn over the pages of Hearne's <i>Diary</i>,
for instance, we constantly meet with accounts of literary
curiosities and rarities, which we regard with different
eyes by virtue of our enlarged information, while thousands
of really valuable items&mdash;valuable on some score or other&mdash;go
there unnoted, although copies of them must have
passed through the sales, even more frequently than at
present. The close of the nineteenth century has brought
these matters to a truer level. We are better able to
gauge the survival of books and editions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[<a href="./images/136.png">136</a>]</span>
Even in the sometimes tedious enumeration of editions
of early books bibliography confers a sort of benefit, for
it demonstrates the longevity in public estimation and
demand of a host of books now neglected, yet objects of
interest and utility to many successive ages.</p>

<p>We have seen so many cranks and fancies successively
take possession of the public. Early typography; early
poetry and romances; books of hours; books of emblems;
Roman Catholic literature; liturgies; Bewick; Bartolozzi;
the first edition (which was sometimes equally the
last); books on vellum, on India-paper, or on yellow
or some other bizarre colour or material, debarring perusal
of the publication; copies with remarkable blunders
or with some of the text inadvertently omitted&mdash;all these
and a legion of others have had their day; and to some
of them it happens that they drop out of view for a
season, and then reappear for a second or third brief
term of life and favour; and therefore, it being so, who
can have the heart to blame the parties that in the
exercise of their vocation make hay while the sun shines?
There is one personage, and one alone, who makes it
whether or no, summer and winter, to wit, the auctioneer;
his commission is assured; on what or from whom he gets
it he cares not. He cheerfully leaves the adjustment of
accounts to gentlemen outside.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which a new departure takes
place, often without much previous warning, in the book-market,
and disturbs the calculations of holders of certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[<a href="./images/137.png">137</a>]</span>
classes of stock, are infinitely varied. The bibliographical
barometer is surprisingly sensitive, and the slightest
change of fashion in the older literature, and even in
those sections of the more recent which embrace acknowledged
rarities, is instantaneously felt. In some branches
of collecting, and where the prices of commodities are
such as to exclude all but a knot of wealthy amateurs, the
entrance of a new-comer on the ground makes a vital
difference, especially if the market is in need of support
from existing wants having been supplied; and if one
goes about a little, one hears men whispering in corners
and questioning who the stranger is, and for what he
is likely to prove good. Should he be a strong man,
that is, in purse, you will soon perceive, if you keep your
eye on the auction-room, another strong man buying at
all costs against all comers just the articles which commend
themselves to the first <i>dramatis persona</i>. He buys
nearly everything; they are for him alone, unless there
are two in the field concurrently, and then one may be
conveniently played off against the other. A small field
it is!</p>

<p>And this interesting commercial strategy is always
going on, while the objects of pursuit continually vary.
The dealer looks after, not his own desiderata&mdash;for he
has none&mdash;but those of his immediate clients. In a
large business a man is likely to have many; but the
class which repays study, which turns sovereigns into
bank-notes for him, is not a numerous one. Half-a-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[<a href="./images/138.png">138</a>]</span>dozen
first-rate customers keep a shop open even in the
most fashionable and expensive thoroughfare. The late
Joseph Lilly leant during his last years mainly on one.
A collector of the stamp of Mr. Hartley was almost
sufficient to support such an establishment as Newman's
in Holborn or Toovey's in Piccadilly. You might pass the
latter, or both, day after day and week after week, and not
see a soul enter or leave the premises; all was done by
correspondence and flukes and a few real good buyers in
the background. Mr. Quaritch in London or M. Fontaine
in Paris will clear more in an afternoon by the change of
hands of two or three heavy items than a small dealer,
even if he is unusually lucky, will do in a twelvemonth
out of thousands of petty and troublesome transactions.
It is not particularly unusual for a big firm to sell at
one sitting four or five thousand pounds worth of property.
There are others which have not sold as much
during the entire term of their career, and never will.</p>

<p>The works which enjoy their turn of public favour are
generally recognisable in the catalogues by the type in
which they are set forth; and any one who has stood
by and witnessed all the changes of the last thirty or
forty years observes periodical phenomena in the transfer
of typographical honours from one school of authors, or
one group of subjects, to another. The most recent
auctioneers' catalogues reflect the sentiment of the day
in lavishing capitals on trifles from the pens of more or
less ephemeral modern writers, and registering with corre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>sponding
brevity much of the old English literature, which
a few years since was in the ascendant. A rare volume
of Elizabethan verse or prose halts after an insignificant
brochure by Lamb, Dickens, or Thackeray, which the
respective authors would have judged scarcely worth preserving,
to which their indifference, in point of fact, constitutes
the cause of scarcity and consequent appreciation.</p>

<p>So it was once upon a time, to be sure, with the
Caxton, the quarto Shakespeare, the ballad, the penny
black-letter garland, and many another article which
we now hold so precious. The man who could secure
Caxtons and Shakespeares for pence, was he happier?
Why, no; for he simply followed the market and nobody
was envious. He lifted his acquisition off the counter or
stall for the best of all reasons&mdash;because he fancied it&mdash;nay,
because he intended to read it when he reached home.</p>

<p>A plea from the absolute collector's point of view&mdash;I
fear, a weak and false one&mdash;is occasionally advanced
for books which were formerly in fashion and favour;
for example, Sylvester's <i>Du Bartas</i>, the Platonic romances,
Townley's French <i>Hudibras</i>, and a hundred&mdash;a thousand&mdash;ten
thousand more. It is thought to be worth while
to have a few of these deposed idols to show to your
friends when they visit you, that they may join in a
homily on changes of taste. Perhaps it would suffice
to compare notes through the medium of some <i>Censura
Literaria</i>, or Beloe, or Collier. With most people space
is a consideration, with a few, money; and an incidental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
and passing reflection need not be so costly in either way.
For that reason such works as I have indicated, and a
few others similar to them, are apt to prove serviceable
and economical.</p>

<p>The periodical reinforcement of the ranks of the
book-collecting world, in the higher latitudes at least,
is obviously imperative, as individuals do not usually
commence investments of such a kind till they are
well on in life and have put by a fortune, or at all
events retired from business. Some purely accidental
matter directs attention to a line of bibliography which
appears attractive and important; the money is there,
and the expert will undertake the rest. It is not the
interest of those engaged in the business to be critical;
they are merely executive agents. But the demand for
the costlier rarities and curiosities is so narrow, that the
fresh aspirant is soon the central object of attention to
the few who can provide him with what he imagines he
wants. As a rule, where a man has no personal knowledge,
and finds that he is gradually becoming a milch-cow
for the trade, the hobby is not of long duration; it is
only where the buyer can control and check the vendor
that satisfactory relations are likely to continue, perhaps
for years, perhaps for a lifetime. There is ever a
tendency, on the part of the bookish commissariat, to
strike the iron too hard.</p>

<p>It does happen here and there that collectors are
enabled to make their own prices for their acquisitions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<a href="./images/141.png">141</a>]</span>
either by extraordinary reputation for judgment and by
virtue of a well-known name, or by the fact of being
carried by our common lot beyond earshot of their good
fortune, or, once more, by the force of peculiar circumstances.
As an almost inexorable rule, the stocks of
dealers are coldly regarded, and even those of William
Pickering and Joseph Lilly were allowed to drop, so
that, in the latter instance more particularly, some
real bargains were obtained. Yet, on the contrary,
the books thrown on the market after the retirement of
F. S. Ellis and the death of James Toovey went capitally,
partly because they were supported by Mr. Quaritch
(rather glad perhaps to get rid of his two confr&egrave;res).
Then, more recently, the collection formed by Mr.
Warton brought quite unexpected figures, and we feel
justified in adding, figures sometimes scarcely warranted
by the property. These instances, and this other aspect
of the subject, strengthen our contention that the whole
affair from beginning to end is a sort of lottery, a type of
gambling. If those who enter into the fray do so with
their eyes open, and do not object, who should?</p>

<p>But assuredly the most egregious case in modern
times of the absolute despotism of name and ownership
over all other considerations was that of the portion of
William Morris's library submitted to public sale in
December 1898. The books themselves were, as a rule,
below mediocrity in state, and could not have well
possessed for the new acquirers even that special interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span>
and value which Morris recognised in them as aids to
his artistic and literary labours. Yet the prices realised
were beyond anything on record, and were simply absurd.
There seemed to be a violent struggle on the part of three
or four competitors to secure these treasures at any cost,
and they did so. Let the very same copies recur, and
in the hands of a person of inferior celebrity, and the
shrinkage will probably be serious. The direct association
was dissolved when the lots were adjudged to the
highest bidders, and here the highest bidders were high
indeed.</p>

<p>To the speculative investor in literary property what
can we have to say? He works with his eyes opened
to their widest possibility of expansion, and carries his
fortune or success in his hands. No doubt there are
occasional flukes for him; but, generally speaking, the
greatest have been for collections formed and dispersed
without any view to profit, where the state of the market
has accidentally favoured the owner, or there was some
nimbus round the name.</p>

<p>Before you set about forming a library, you should
consider in what sort of atmosphere, of your own or your
friends' creation, it is likely to be sold hereafter. You
ought almost to be able to calculate how celebrated you
will die.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> entire range of the earlier English and Scotish
romantic, poetical, and even historical literature embraces
so many items, which are either unattainable from their
rarity or their cost, if they happen once in a lifetime to
occur, that it may be said to be ground almost closed
against the ordinary private buyer. Articles which are
to be seen by the hundred in the priced catalogues of
libraries dispersed twenty or thirty years since with fairly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>
moderate figures attached to them, have, owing to
severer competition from America as well as at home,
either for public or private purchasers, trebled or quadrupled
in value. With the more modern literature, of
which the positive scarcity does not warrant this great
inflation, we may reasonably look for a fall; but in the
case of volumes which are really rare, it is hard to see
how the chances of collectors can be improved in the
future. The upshot will be, that they must be satisfied
with smaller fish or modify their lines; for of old and
elderly books of intrinsic value and interest there is a
plentiful choice. With regard to a considerable body of
Early English volumes, which formerly appeared in the
catalogues of Thorpe, Rodd, the elder Pickering, and
others, it is to be said that the fewness of survivors
was not appreciated, and half-a-dozen public or closed
libraries have absorbed them all.</p>

<p>It exemplifies the remarkable revolution in feeling
and taste when we turn over the pages of one of William
Pickering's catalogues&mdash;that for 1827&mdash;and observe a perfect
set of the four folio Shakespeares, 1623-85, marked
&pound;105, while a large-paper series of Hearne's books, or
of some standard edition of the classics in morocco,
cost more; whereas at present the Hearnes and the
classics are barely saleable at any price, and the dramatic
volumes might be worth twenty times more than they
brought seventy years since.</p>

<p>The poetical writers of the Tudor, Elizabethan, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<a href="./images/145.png">145</a>]</span>
Stuart eras have had, in a commercial sense, two or three
reverses of fortune. From the period of publication down
to the last quarter of the eighteenth century they were to be
bought at prices little beyond waste paper, so soon as the
original interest in them had subsided. The editors of
Shakespeare&mdash;Pope, Hanmer, Theobald, Warburton, Capell,
Steevens, Malone, Farmer, and Reed&mdash;awakened a sort of
new interest in the subject, just in time to save the
slender salvage of a century and a half's neglect or indifference
from the mill and the kitchen-fire; and their
example led to others coming upon the ground, such
as West, Major Pearson, the Duke of Roxburghe, Lord
Blandford, Lord Spencer, Bindley, and Heber, whose
motives were primarily acquisitive. In or about 1833 a
strong reaction set in, and prices fell till 1842-45, when
the Bright and Chalmers sales, and the more sensible
competition of the British Museum, again restored confidence
and strength to the market. Since that time, our
old poets have not, on the whole, suffered any marked
decline, and the most recent revival is in their favour.</p>

<p>The Americans, it seems, call for first editions, and
they have not to call twice, though they may be required
to pay smartly. This new ticket owes its origin to the
usual agency. One or two Transatlantic book-lovers gain
the information from some source that this is the real
article, that if you want fine poetry you must go to these
fellows&mdash;not exactly Shakespeare and Spenser, for they
had heard of them before&mdash;but to Gascoigne, Sydney,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>
Herrick, Carew, Suckling, Lovelace, and the rest of the
company; and above all, if you desire to enjoy their
beauties and appreciate their genius fully and absolutely,
you are referred to the <i>editio princeps</i>&mdash;not that which
the author corrected and preferred, but the one in
morocco extra, which your bookseller recommends to you.</p>

<p>It is by no means that we seek to ridicule or discourage
the pursuit, but we want and wish to see a more healthy
and discriminating spirit among buyers. Let intending
collectors devote a reasonable time to a preparatory study
of the subject and survey of the field and then they will
perhaps accomplish better results at a lower cost. Let
them, once more, not be in too violent a hurry. The
abundance of transmitted writings in a metrical shape
only proves more conclusively the familiar fact that it
is as easy to compose verses as it is difficult to compose
poetry. The long succession of authors who fall within
the category of poets has received an extent of editorial
care and illustration in the course of the century, however,
which argues the prevalence of a more favourable opinion
of their merits. The names which are at present commanding
chief notice are those which have always been
esteemed: Shakespeare, Fletcher, Beaumont, Jonson,
Daniel, Drayton, Wither, Sir John Davis, Herrick, Carew,
Lovelace, and Suckling; and among the Scotish bards
Drummond takes the lead. The most singular feature
about the matter is that, in the presence of all kinds of
critical editions, the demand is not for them, but for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>
originals. The mission of the modern recensor comes to
an end when, by a stupendous amount of research and
erudition, he has emphasised the characteristics and gifts
of a writer. Then the amateur steps forward, and expresses
his readiness to give any price for the good old
book, undisfigured by notes and emendations!</p>

<p>It is perhaps fruitless to attempt to turn the tide of
common sentiment, and gentlemen must be permitted to
choose their own money's worth. They may think and
say that they want the volume as it left the author's
hands, not diluted and overlaid by commentators.
Granted, it is a product of the time, even though the
author did not see the proofs, and the printer could not
always decipher the MS. But then comes the larger and
more general question: How much of the better class of
early verse-writers are worth reading? The present deponent,
without being conscious that he is very hyper-critical,
states the deliberate result of actual examination
and perusal when he affirms that of the minor poets of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, save perhaps Randolph,
the productions of enduring value and interest could
be brought within the compass of a moderate volume.</p>

<p>It would be eminently unwise for any one who treats
his library as an investment to yield to the existing
tendency to exorbitant prices for the later poets and
playwrights, as the rise is due to ephemeral causes, and
the demand, for the most part, is not likely to exhaust
the supply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<a href="./images/148.png">148</a>]</span>
If the truth may be told, the literature of past ages
in all countries, and nowhere more so than in England, is,
in proportion to its immense extent, excessively barren of
high-class writers or written matter. Each generation of
collectors discovers this fact at last; but it discovers it
for itself. We disdain to profit by the experience of our
precursors, just as the little girl insisted on learning at
her own cost how foolish it was to do a certain thing.
Because there are a few highly interesting catholic publications,
your amateur must be absolutely complete in
the series. If it seems expedient to possess an example
or two of ancient typography, he ends by doing his best
to accumulate every example in the market. There is
more than a probability that the service-books of the
Romish Church have their arch&aelig;ological and literary value:
<i>ergo</i>, he orders every one which he sees advertised, albeit
the differences are substantially far from momentous.
He understands that some very curious volumes illustrative
of ritualism and the various holy orders were printed here
or abroad, and he proceeds to drain the booksellers'
shelves throughout the universe of every bit of sorry stuff
answering to this description. There are a dozen or so of
Collections of Emblems, English or foreign, which are
supposed to throw light on passages in Shakespeare and
other authors; this is sufficient leverage for the concentration
under the unfortunate gentleman's roof of a closely
packed cartload.</p>

<p>Seriously and bibliographically speaking, there is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[<a href="./images/149.png">149</a>]</span>
fairly wide difference and disparity among the old editions
of the poets and romancists; and there are, and always
will be, a distinguished minority, of which the selling
prices may be expected to remain firm. Such men as
Shakespeare, Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher, Chapman,
Massinger, and among the lyric group Barnfield, Watson,
Constable, Wither (earlier works and <i>Hallelujah</i>), Carew,
Herrick, Suckling, and Lovelace, are to be viewed as
standard and stable.</p>

<p>Then in the Scotish series there is permanence in
Lyndsay, Drummond, and Burns. But, on the contrary,
the minor, more obscure, or commoner productions must
be carefully distinguished and circumspectly handled by
those who do not desire or cannot afford to throw away
their money. The names above cited are themselves very
unequal; some, like Breton, Churchyard, Whetstone,
Barnfield, Watson, and Constable, are sought, and will
ever be sought, by reason of their peculiar rarity; and,
save in a sentimental way, no one would probably dream of
placing Beaumont, Chapman, Wither, and some of the rest
on a par with Shakespeare, Fletcher, and Massinger. There
has been, however, a tendency to force on the notice of book-buyers,
<i>faute de mieux</i>, many writers whose productions
are neither rare nor of the first class&mdash;Heywood, Dekker,
Webster, Ford, and Shirley&mdash;and to bracket them commercially
with authentic <i>desiderata</i> either on the score
of merit or of scarcity. Of the three former, the most
difficult pieces to procure are the Civic Pageants. Nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[<a href="./images/150.png">150</a>]</span>
all Ford's and Shirley's works, except the <i>Echo</i> of the
latter, 1618, are classable among common books even in
the first editions.</p>

<p>Again, condition is a postulate which begins to assert
itself in the book-market. Poor and bad copies are
eschewed by many or most of those who are willing to
pay handsomely for fine specimens; and the worst type
of indifferent exemplars is the sophisticated volume,
which can be manipulated by experts to such an extent
that even a person of considerable experience will
now and then be at fault. The American collector
grows more fastidious every day, and discovers blemishes
which we on this side of the water try to tolerate, if
the article is rare or we badly want it. Our Transatlantic
friends, however, are more inexorable, and go
so far as to return purchases not answering the description
in the auctioneer's catalogue to their English commission-agents.</p>

<p>We have instanced above two or three writers whose
works command excessive prices mainly by virtue of the
paucity of surviving copies, seconded by a faint and
indirect literary interest; but we see that the list is open
to extension. During the last half-century and upward
the publications of Nicholas Breton have fetched sums,
when they have occurred, totally incompatible with any intrinsic
value; with some few exceptions they belong to the
category of "three-halfpenny ware," as Chamberlain the
letter-writer styles such things in his correspondence with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>
Sir Dudley Carleton; half-a-dozen or so out of forty and
more are undoubtedly curious and illustrative; but Mr.
Corser and one or two other collectors made a speciality
of the author. It is only the other day that Sir John
Fenn's copy of Breton's <i>Works of a Young Wit</i>, 1577,
recorded by Herbert in his <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>,
and the only perfect one known, occurred at an auction
and fetched &pound;81! A fine book it was, too, with the
blank leaf at end. Doubtless, the reason for the evanescence
of Breton's literary labours is to be sought in
their estimation by many, besides the letter-writer above
quoted, as barely more than waste paper. Verily, their
substantial worth is barely tangible.</p>

<p>Speaking from a connoisseur's rather than from a
reader's point of view, when we leave behind us the pre-Restoration
writers of Great Britain and Ireland, we do
not encounter much difficulty in a commercial sense, if
we consider the length of time and the almost innumerable
names, excepting Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, Swift's
<i>Gulliver</i>, Defoe's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, Goldsmith's <i>Vicar of
Wakefield</i>, and a few early Byrons and Shelleys, unless
the buyer schedules among his <i>desiderata</i> the earlier
Anglo-American literature. For as we draw nearer to
our own day, items which were thought to be superlatively
uncommon, including sundry pieces by Tennyson
and Browning, have failed to maintain their reputation
for scarcity, as any one might have foreseen that they
would do. The preposterous prices paid for some copies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[<a href="./images/152.png">152</a>]</span>
have brought out others, and the ultimate supply will
probably exceed the demand.</p>

<p>Even where an English collection may not enter the
Continental lines, but preserves its national character,
there are numerous classes of books of foreign origin and
from foreign presses, which are fairly entitled to consideration
and admittance. These publications embrace not
merely religious and controversial literature, but a large
and important body of material for English and Scotish
biography and history, and for the elucidation of Irish
affairs. Every season brings to light some new features
in this immense series, which is, of course, susceptible of
a classifying process, and may be ranged under such
sections as we have above indicated, besides a considerable
residue which falls under the head of poetry and
typography, the latter constituting a branch of the
History of English Printing, and the former being worthy
of notice as embracing some of the rarest metrical productions
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which
owed their issue from presses in Germany and the Low
Countries to various agencies, but chiefly to the exigencies
of foreign military service by English and Scotish officers
during the English operations in the Netherlands under
Elizabeth and during the Thirty Years' War.</p>

<p>The foreign sources of English books, or books
written by or about English, Scotish, and Irish folk,
have been&mdash;</p>

<p>It is always to be borne in mind that these adjuncts at
the foot of title-pages in troubled periods are not unfrequently
fictitious; and we have elsewhere equally shown
that Greenwich and Waterford are names appended to
early controversial works of which the writers desired to
conceal the real parentage.</p>

<p>Of English presses it might seem almost superfluous
to speak; but in fact the typographical fortunes of London
have experienced their flux and reflux. At first we find
the City itself in sole possession of the industry and
privilege; then Westminster came; thirdly, Southwark.
Of the provincial places of origin, Oxford appears to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[<a href="./images/154.png">154</a>]</span>
been the foremost, and was followed at intervals by
York, Cambridge, Canterbury, Ipswich, Worcester, and
other centres, of which some preserved their reputation
down to comparatively recent times, while Oxford and
Cambridge of course remain important and busy seats
of printing. Beverley, Nottingham, Derby, Northampton,
Bristol, Birmingham, Gateshead, and Newcastle-on-Tyne
have never been more than occasional sources of literary
production, and certain towns, such as Lincoln and Gainsborough,
are only known from local or small popular
efforts; there is an edition of <i>Robin Hood's Garland</i>
with the Gainsborough imprint. One or two publications
purporting to have been executed at Sherborne in
Dorsetshire belong to the firm of William Bowyer of
London.</p>

<p>There was a distinct centralising tendency at a later
period, by which the English metropolis absorbed the
principal share of work, and it was followed, owing to
economical causes, by a reaction which we know to be at
present in full force, and which has restored to the provinces,
but to new localities, Bungay, Guildford, Bristol,
no less than Edinburgh and Aberdeen, an appreciable
proportion of the custom of the London publishing houses;
nor is it unusual to send MSS. abroad for the sake of the
advantage accruing from cheaper labour. We not long
since secured this boon in Scotland; but Scotland has
grown as dear as London.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Scotish Series</span> is a difficult and costly one to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[<a href="./images/155.png">155</a>]</span>
handle. The early vernacular literature of that country
has suffered from two classes of destructive agency, neglect
and fanaticism, to a greater extent than England, and the
disappearance of the more popular books and tracts has
been wholesale. The attempt on the part of a collector,
however rich and persevering he might be, to form a
complete series of original editions of the poetical and
romantic writers of North Britain, could only be made in
ignorance of the utter impossibility of success. The late
David Laing abundantly illustrated this fact in his
numerous publications, and further evidence of it may be
found throughout the bibliographical works of the present
writer.</p>

<p>The old Scotish presses were Edinburgh, Leith, St.
Andrew's, Glasgow, Stirling, and Aberdeen; but a large
proportion of the literary productions of Scotish authors,
including much of the historical group relative to Mary
Queen of Scots, proceeded from foreign places of origin,
where the writers had settled or were temporarily resident.</p>

<p>The principal channels through which we have in
modern times augmented our information of their products
are the catalogues of Fraser of Lovat, Boswell of
Auchinleck, the Duke of Roxburghe, Pitcairn, Constable,
Chalmers, Maidment, Gibson-Craig, David Laing, and
the Rev. William Makellar, the last a cousin of Sir
William Stirling Maxwell of Keir, and a collector from
1838 to 1898.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[<a href="./images/156.png">156</a>]</span>
A purely <span class="smcap">Irish Library</span> would inherently differ both
from one limited to English or to Scotish books. There
is no early typography or poetry, no works printed on
vellum, no masterpieces of binding. The collectors in
that part of the empire have always been few in number,
and in fact Irish books have been chiefly collected by
persons who were not Irishmen, nor even residents in that
country. It used to be the case that, where a book was
remarkably successful in England, the Dublin booksellers
reprinted it, and, as these reproductions are generally
scarcer than the originals, doubtless in limited numbers.</p>

<p>The series consists of a handful of books and tracts of
the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods (1570-1625); of
publications relative to the Civil War (1644-48); of
others relative to the Commonwealth and Jacobite troubles
(1650-90); of literary illustrations of the state of Ireland
under the Houses of Orange, Stuart, and Brunswick or
Hanover, and of modern days. The bibliographical writings
of Sir James Ware are usually quoted and consulted
for the literature within his time, but they have become
almost obsolete. The two other works of reference for
amateurs and students are those by Charles Vallancey
(<i>Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis</i>, 1786-1807, 7 vols.) and
Charles O'Conor (<i>Rerum Hibernicarum Scriptores Veteres</i>,
1814-26, 4 vols.).</p>

<p>But we have to go to more recent authorities to discover
that the typographical productions of Ireland in the first
decade of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries comprise a few books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[<a href="./images/157.png">157</a>]</span>
of the greatest rarity and one or two of which no copies
are at present known. On the other hand, certain Elizabethan
volumes, purporting to have proceeded from Irish
presses, are generally believed to have an English origin,
while others with German imprints of a later date (second
half of the seventeenth century) are absolutely proved to
have been clandestinely executed at home.</p>

<p>A very fair and comprehensive idea of the salient
features in the present series may be gained from the
Grenville and Huth catalogues and from Hazlitt's <i>Collections</i>
(General Index). Considerable stress is laid by
collectors on a large-paper copy with the <i>Decisions</i>
filled in in MS., the Memorandum, &amp;c., of the <i>List of
Claims</i>, 1701, in connection with the Irish forfeitures.
But in fact a copy of this work is always available, when
any one wants it, which is seldom enough.</p>

<p>There was no <i>regular</i> printing here till the beginning
of the seventeenth century, although one or two Marian
tracts falsely purport to have come from the Waterford
press. Dublin had a printer, John Frankton, who worked
from 1601 to 1620 or thereabout, and produced many
books, tracts, and broadsheets, some not yet recovered;
the city also boasted a Society of Stationers in 1608, and
many volumes appeared at London "Printed for the
Partners of the Irish Stock," referring to the Plantation of
Ulster. The places in Ireland itself, where the art of
typography was pursued, were Dublin, Cork, Waterford,
Drogheda, Kilkenny, and Belfast (as in the section just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span>
dismissed). But the rarest articles in the earlier series
emanated from London or from Continental presses, the
writings of Nicholas French and Cranford's <i>Tears of Ireland</i>,
1642, taking a prominent rank in the latter category.</p>

<p>The leading collectors on Irish lines have been Sir
Robert Peel, Mr. Grenville, Mr. Huth, Mr. Bradshaw,
Canon Tierney, Mr. Shirley, and Bishop Daly.</p>

<p>In the English series I have supposed the admission
of a certain number or proportion of foreign books, which
are of catholic interest, and have acquired a standing
among many classes of collectors whose bias is principally
national. But there are two other series of very unequal
extent, importance, and costliness, which more directly
appeal to the buyers of these islands, namely, the earlier
Anglo-American literature belonging to the Colonial
period, and the American reproductions of the favourite
books of Lamb, Leigh Hunt, Hazlitt, Thackeray, and
others in the present century. The latter category enters
into the department of curiosities, and has yet to acquire
bibliographical importance. In one or two cases, works
issued at home in numbers have been published in
the States in book-form prior to their appearance
here. This happened with the <i>Yellow-Plush Correspondence</i>,
reprinted direct from <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> at Philadelphia
in 1838, and curious as the writer's earliest
separate publication. These papers were not collected in
England till 1841.</p>

<p>The products of the Colonial period include all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<a href="./images/159.png">159</a>]</span>
books emanating from American presses between 1640, the
date of the <i>Bay Psalm-Book</i> at Cambridge, N.E., from
the press of Stephen Day, and the Declaration of Independence.
There has been a disposition to treat the whole
of this output of printed matter with a special tenderness
and reverence on political grounds; but it obviously is of
a very mixed and unequal character, and, as time goes
on, there must be a continuous winnowing process, and
a consignment to oblivion of a vast assortment of the
dullest theology and of political <i>ephemerides</i>. There will
always remain a rich heirloom to our American kinsfolk
and ourselves of historical nuggets in the shape of
narratives of the fortunes and careers of the Pilgrim
Fathers, their experiments in statecraft, their religious
trials, their early superstitions and strange intolerance
of personal liberty in a land chosen by its settlers for
liberty's sake; and of course there is a section of literary
products appertaining to the New World, namely, ritualistic
ordinances, liturgical manuals, and collections of statutes,
which derive what one is bound to term an artificial
interest from the local circumstances, or, in other words,
from the place of origin. A theological treatise, a Bible,
a volume of prayers, or a law-book, published in England
in the second half of the seventeenth century, may be
worth from sixpence to a sovereign; if it bears the
imprint of Boston, Cambridge (N.E.), New York, Philadelphia,
or New London, its value may be computed in
bank-notes. The <i>Laws of Massachusetts</i>, 1660, was lately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[<a href="./images/160.png">160</a>]</span>
sold for &pound;109, and the <i>Papers Relating to Massachusetts
Bay</i>, 1769, for &pound;8, the latter in boards. The reason (so
far as there is any) for this inflation is twofold: the
patriotic sentiment which leads American amateurs to
desire the oldest and most precious typographical and
historical monuments of their country, and, secondly, the
perhaps less justifiable enthusiasm of some Englishmen
for books which, as they may plead, are the offspring
of the States while they were still English settlements.
A copious and fairly contemporary view of the extensive
family of works belonging to the earlier Anglo-American
library may be found in the bibliographies of Stevens,
Sabin, and Harrisse, and in the Grenville, Huth, Lenox,
and Tower catalogues. There is not only no line of
collecting which is more difficult and more costly than
the present, but none which, within the last twenty years,
has, so far as first-rate rarities are concerned, more
seriously advanced, even inferior copies of certain books
fetching at times five times as much as good ones did in
the seventies. Just lately the call appears to come from
the other side of the Atlantic. There are two or three
new bidders. That is sufficient.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the acquisition of modern books, far greater caution is
requisite than in that of the older literature, since the
output is so enormous, and the changes in taste and
depreciation in value so rapid and so capricious. The
Free and other Circulating or Reference Libraries throughout
the country must prove of immense service in superseding
the necessity of purchasing volumes of temporary
interest or of expensive character; and the average collector
will, and does, find that a certain number of
dictionaries of various kinds, and of works which happen
to be favourites, suffice to exhaust his space and resources.
The Free Library is an undoubted boon in two ways:
in enabling us to read or consult books which we do
not care to buy; and again, in affording us an oppor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<a href="./images/162.png">162</a>]</span>tunity
at leisure of judging whether such and such a
volume merits more than a passing notice and perusal.
The sole method of arriving at this information is to
take the publication home. Even where shelf-room and
funds are forthcoming, there is slight danger of any large
percentage of recent literature being added to the stores
of a judicious householder. To read, perhaps only to
skim, and return, will be the general rule.</p>

<p>It is inexpedient to lend oneself too exclusively to a
period or a school; for even where one has to study for
a purpose a particular class of authors, or a particular
subject or group of subjects, the local institution is at
hand to help one; and the cheap reproductions of the
writings of the earlier centuries, erring, as they do, on
the side of indulgence, place it in the power of individuals
of modest means to have at their elbows a representative
assemblage, not necessarily a cumbrous one, of the literature
from Chaucer to the present day, so that they may
form a comparative estimate of the intellectual activity
and wealth of successive ages, while, at the same time,
the Greek and Latin authors are procurable in a collective
shape, if they desire to compare notes and satisfy
themselves on the obligations of the moderns to the
ancients.</p>

<p>It amounts to this, that the Free Library is an agency
which should save us to a very material extent from
actually acquiring books which are not worth holding;
it is not only a medium for reference, but for testing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
and winnowing. But for the select private bookcase it
is not, or ought not to be, a substitute.</p>

<p>The Free Library is in its infancy and on its trial.
In course of time the spread of education and the force
of experience will confer on it better governing bodies,
and better governing bodies will guarantee better curators.
The actual generation of librarians, or so-called librarians,
is the product of inefficient committees of control and
selection; and the worst part is that some of these gentlemen
receive salaries which would almost enable their
employers to secure the services of qualified officers.</p>

<p>I am not personally of the opinion that those institutions
are an unmixed blessing. For already there was a
marked tendency to a decline in the taste for collecting
among the middle classes in the United Kingdom,
available resources being devoted to other outlets more
generally acceptable to families; and the facilities afforded
by the Free Library virtually amount to each individual
parishioner being enabled, without appreciable cost, to
possess books on a far larger scale than if he had a
collection actually his own. The unfavourable operation
of this state of affairs is twofold: it injures the literary
market, and it promotes superficiality of study in the
case of books which should be owned, not borrowed, to
be thoroughly mastered and understood.</p>

<p>The range of choice, which embraces the writers of
the modern school in prose and verse, is both wide
and difficult. During many years past the number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span>
authors within these lines has been continually on the
increase, yet, while merit and value may be questions
of opinion, there can be no serious or legitimate doubt
that the output of literary work of high character is
not greater than it was, if indeed as great. In the
course of a quarter of a century many popular names
have either fallen or faded out of remembrance, alike
of authors who belonged to antecedent generations, and
of those who have enjoyed a transient and artificial
celebrity, and have come and gone, as it were, under
the eyes of their immediate contemporaries. With the
advantages offered by lending libraries, it appears to be
imprudent on the part of any one who cannot conveniently
form an extensive collection of modern books to buy on
the recommendation of the press or the trade new favourites;
for literary acquisitions are unfortunately apt to
occupy space, and, save in very exceptional cases, to
deteriorate in value. Even the original editions of the
later works of Tennyson are not in great demand, and
the high figures realised by one or two of his early
productions are explainable in the same way as those
given for Byrons and Shelleys.</p>

<p>The Modern Side of collecting is classifiable into
numerous branches, according to the point of departure,
as some differ in their view of what is modern from
others. If we have to lay down a dividing line, however,
we should make it comprehend the last decade of
the eighteenth century, when many of the writers who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
were the contemporaries of our immediate foregoers
began their literary careers.</p>

<p>Then, again, there are two branches of the later
literature: the more recent writers themselves, and the
reproductions, as I have noted, of the writers of former
periods; and the extent to which the edited collections
have been carried places it within the power of many
who so desire to specialise on a certain line, and to deal
representatively with the rest.</p>

<p>The specialist who proposes to himself as a field for
his activity the Coleridge and Byron period, or who,
again, confines his efforts to the writings of one or two
of that set, has his work before him. Generally speaking,
the first editions, which are those usually desired, are not
uncommon; but there is almost always a <i>crux</i>, an <i>introuvable</i>,
for which the not altogether blameable dealer
puts on the screw, and charges more than for all the
remaining items. Bohn's <i>Lowndes</i> yields a fair account
of this family of literature; and Alexander Ireland,
Richard Herne Shepherd, and others have bestowed vast
pains on drawing up monographs on Coleridge, Hazlitt,
Hunt, Shelley, Lamb, Keats, Browning, Tennyson, and
the rest. It is difficult to foresee what the final upshot
may be; probably, when fabulous prices have drawn forth
from their hiding-places additional copies of many of
these latter-day objects of keen pursuit, the market will
fall and the craze will subside. It is a purely artificial
and spurious one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
A second group, to whose books a collector may
reasonably and conveniently confine his attention, consists
of the poets and prose-writers who are still, or
who were till lately, among us; and a fairly numerous
body of matter falls within this class, as we may judge
from a glance at the names which present themselves in
the publishers' and booksellers' lists. In selecting the
contemporary school, there is the undoubted advantage
that you can institute a comparison between the book
and its author, and that you may fall in with him at
dinner, in a drawing-room or in a shop, and congratulate
him or solicit an explanation of some fine but
obscure passage; and should you also be literary, he
has the opportunity of exchanging compliments with
you. The old dead writers receive praise and offer no
equivalent.</p>

<p>During a series of years there was a notorious run,
which, as usual, became indiscriminate, on first editions
of the writings of Dickens, Thackeray, and other foremost
men of the period, eclipsing, as it seemed, even the
demand for the earlier English classics, till the auctioneers
and booksellers in their catalogues underlined at a
venture every <i>editio princeps</i>, though it might be the
last as well as the first, and, whether or no, a book of
no mark. But the enthusiasm has at last contracted
itself within narrower and more intelligent limits, and is
restricted to productions which rank as masterpieces or
are special favourites, and then all postulates have to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<a href="./images/167.png">167</a>]</span>
satisfied, all bibliographical minuti&aelig; have to be studied.
It is impossible to foresee how far this latest compromise
may last; but whatever it is, there must always be some
novelty to keep the market going, and bring grist to the
mill. The world of fashion comprehends books as well
as bonnets and dresses; but the literary section is a
humble one by comparison, and is in few hands. Every
fresh <i>mode</i> has somewhere its starter, and it usually prevails
long enough to suit the purposes of the trade,
when it makes way for its successor.</p>

<p>If one had the ordering of these strategical devices,
one would imagine that the true policy was to buy up
a given class of books, procure the insertion of a clever
article or two in the press, extolling their merits and
lamenting the public ignorance and neglect, and then
launch a Jesuitically constructed catalogue devoted to
such undeservedly disregarded treasures. But we may
have been forestalled. Who knows?</p>

<p>The less current and every-day literary ware appeals
to a more or less narrow constituency. There is a
proverb, "The wool-seller knows the wool-buyer;" and
it has to be so in books. There are volumes which, if
they do not from their character or price suit one of a
circle of half-a-dozen collectors, with whose means and
wants the whole trade is generally familiar, are exceedingly
likely to suit nobody outside the public libraries
at public library prices. So much is this the case, that
many booksellers do not think it worth their while to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>
publish catalogues, and content themselves with reporting
to the most probable purchaser fresh acquisitions. With
certain very special and costly rarities <i>two</i> often make
a market.</p>

<p>Time will perform its habitual office or function for
us and our successors of separating from the multitudinous
accumulation of modern published or printed matter
such portion as, on deliberate inquiry and scrutiny, appears
to be of permanent value. There is no doubt that much
will be thrown aside; but the <i>residuum</i> which will bear
the test of dispassionate judgment must prove considerable
in itself, and also when taken into account as an
appendix to the record left by preceding generations of
writers. There may be certain authors and authoresses
whom our descendants will like to have by them, even
though they may no longer exert a sensible influence on
literature and thought, just as we prize many of the older
schools and types for characteristics and allusions which
strike us as curious or entertaining; and soon, as decade
follows decade, and the twentieth century has well opened, men
and women, who were our grandsires' contemporaries, will
seem through the lengthening vista almost as remote as
they were from the Stuart epoch with its Elizabethan and
Shakespearian traditions.</p>

<p>It is useless and invidious to particularise, and,
besides, when one has drawn up a list of names, which
are more or less obviously ephemeral, one cannot be
certain as to the rest. Some must live; some may.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>
The astonishing demand for the first editions of our
modern poets and novelists has, as was generally anticipated,
subsided, and in some cases almost ceased; and
it is extremely doubtful whether the taste will ever assume
again the same unhealthy proportions. For one result of
the matter has been to make it perfectly clear that copies
of Byron, Shelley, Keats, Coleridge, Lamb, Dickens,
Thackeray, Tennyson, and so forth, exist in much greater
plenty than was at first supposed, though very little reflection
should have sufficed to establish the fact as an eminent
probability; and all that was needed to draw them from
their resting-places was the series of paragraphs in the
press conveying to holders how valuable their property
had unexpectedly become. Shall we not have more copies
of Shelley's poor little brochure of 1810 offered for sale
ere long, as well as of Thackeray's <i>Exquisites</i> and <i>King
Glumpus</i>?</p>

<p>At the same time, while we insist that the survival of
means of supply is too large, and the market too limited,
to sustain the extravagant quotations of recent years,
there will ever remain persons prepared to give generous
prices for absolutely first-class examples of the best modern
authors. There must be no qualification, nothing
secondary, nothing dubious; and with these provisos,
we do not venture to predict that the competition might
not become keener than ever. The same experience will
result here and there, whenever a book forming a desideratum
in more than one cabinet occurs for sale, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>
perhaps the first copy which has been offered. At Sotheby's
in June 1896, Shelley's <i>&OElig;dipus Tyrannus</i>, 1820, it is
said, was carried under these circumstances to &pound;130.
It was, we believe, one of two copies, picked up by a
well-known amateur for fourpence each. On another
account&mdash;its perfectly immaculate state in boards&mdash;a
large-paper copy of Byron's poems, 1807, was thought
by Mr. Edward Huth not too dear at &pound;105. It had been
acquired by a London bookseller in exchange for one in
morocco from a correspondent in Yorkshire, the latter
receiving the bound book (which cost the vendor &pound;27) and
&pound;18 difference, so that there was a profit on the transaction
of &pound;60. Seriously speaking, the purchase was extravagantly
dear, for the book on large paper is at all
events not scarcer than on small. One of the most signal
incidents, however, in modern auctioneering annals was
the sale of MSS. copies of the <i>Endymion</i> and <i>Lamia</i> of
Keats in the poet's handwriting for &pound;1000, and the
subsequent offer to the purchasers at that figure of a large
advance for their bargain. These two items are printed,
and the written copies were those employed by the printer,
as upon the first leaf of each MS. were the directions as to
size. They were in the familiar round schoolboy hand,
and presented occasional corrections. We heard a suggestion
that there might have once, at all events, been
a duplicate copy in existence. If the lots were worth the
money, what would the manuscript of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>
or <i>Hamlet</i> fetch?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>
The mischief which proceeds from the advertisements
through the press of sensational sale prices is not one for
which either the buyers or the sellers are responsible. It
is due to the notorious circumstance that very few persons
are able to discriminate accurately between an important
item in an auction or elsewhere, and another submitted
to their approval, ostensibly and professedly identical,
but actually very different. A certain familiar type of
bookseller will tell you that a copy of such or such a
work fetched &pound;50 under the hammer last week, but that
he can let you have his&mdash;same edition, same date, same
nearly everything&mdash;for fifty shillings. Of course it is no
such matter; yet the bait is often swallowed, and the
poor (or possibly rich) fish caught.</p>

<p>The relatively cheap literature of the present day has
been thought to be a revival rather than an invention.
We meet with tracts published in the reign of Elizabeth
with the express notation of the price of issue, namely,
one penny. The <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, 1549, was to
be sold at 2s. 2d. unbound, and 4s. in paste or boards.
The ordinary amount charged for a tract extending to
thirty or forty pages, and for a quarto play, was 4d. or a
groat. The first folio Shakespeare, 1623, cost the original
purchaser 20s.; Percival's <i>Spanish Dictionary</i>, 1599,
appears to have come out at 12s. There are lists of
advertisements attached to publications of the later Stuart
era showing that a large variety of popular productions
brought the printer or stationer twopence or a penny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[<a href="./images/172.png">172</a>]</span>
A curious little edition of <i>Coffee-House Jests</i>, 1760, bears
the imprint:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Drogheda. Printed for the sake of a Penny:</p>
<p class="ihalf">Sold in Waterford, Cork, and Kilkenny."</p>
</div></div>

<p>But throughout these statistics, which are capable, of
course, of infinite augmentation, we have to keep before us
the difference in the value of money, and the purchasing
power of the same amount in other and more practical
directions; and it follows that the printed matter offered
to-day for threepence or sixpence had no real parallel
in former times, and that the absolutely cheap book is a
product of modern facilities for manufacture.</p>

<p>The published price not unfrequently presents itself
at the foot of the title on books of the late seventeenth
and earlier eighteenth centuries. The simplicity of some
individuals who are ranked among occasional or casual
buyers was illustrated many years since by a man going
into a shop in Fleet Street and putting down eighteenpence
in payment of Hubert's <i>Edward II.</i>, 1721, in the
window. The bookseller explained to him that his price
was 5s. "But," insisted the customer, "look at the title-page;
it was published at 1s. 6d." "Then you had better go
to the publisher," observed the other, replacing the volume.</p>

<p>Book-collecting seems scarcely to concern very closely
those who regard the pursuit from a severely practical
point of view, or in the aspect of absolute intrinsic
importance. It is true enough that one may form, not
only a library, but a remarkably extensive one, of books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[<a href="./images/173.png">173</a>]</span>
of reference and study; but this does not quite answer to
the idea of a bibliophile&mdash;in fact, it is little more than the
digestion into book-form of a mass of learning and useful
information. Again, if, without embracing such classes
of volumes, we limit ourselves to those which, as we
express the matter above, are positively important, we of
course find on our shelves all the capital authors, ancient
and modern; yet how many we should have to reject
which are accounted indispensable to a choice cabinet!
And such is apt to be more peculiarly the case in a selection
formed on Anglo-French lines, as anybody may readily
judge by examining a catalogue of this kind, where pages
and pages are occupied by irritating trifles of no solid pretensions
whatever, not even those evident in personal or
heraldic accessories.</p>

<p>The general rule may be applied to our modern books,
that, whatever they may be for purposes of instruction or
entertainment, they seldom represent the outlay, and still
more rarely a profit upon it when the day arrives for realising.
During some time past we have witnessed the rise and
fall, or at least disappearance from the front rank, of
individuals and schools of individuals whose writings no
amount of friendly support in the press was capable of
propping up beyond three or four seasons. It is not that
some of them may not hereafter, like our older authors,
return to notice and currency; but they will suffer that
intermediate period of neglect which has been experienced
by well-nigh all our greatest names in letters. There is for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[<a href="./images/174.png">174</a>]</span>
literature, in common with its buyers, an earth, a purgatory,
and a heaven&mdash;or something else. The public cannot
keep pace with the vast and unbroken succession of literary
produce, and the favourites of the day pass over to neutral
ground, with very few exceptions, when their honeymoon
has expired, to await the deliberate verdict of posterity
on their merit and their station. To the investor for
a more or less immediate return, however, they are precarious
possessions, unless the market be carefully watched.
The wealthy and absolutely uncommercial amateur disregards
these risks and these counsels; and he is in a sense
to be envied.</p>

<p>The question of the First Edition is not limited to
any era of literary history and production, and the call
for this class of book, at first (as usual) rather unreasoning,
begins to be more critical and narrow. The
author to be thus honoured by his posterity must have a
certain bouquet and vogue. He must be a Shakespeare,
a Jonson, a Herrick, a Burton, a Defoe, a Bunyan, a
Burns, or (if we cross the sea) a Moli&egrave;re, a Montaigne, or
a Cervantes.</p>

<p>With the first edition in some bibliographical schemes
is associated the Best One. The possessor of both may
pride himself on being able to show the earliest and latest
state of the writer's mind, what he originally conceived, and
what he decided to leave behind him as his <i>ultimum vale</i>.
For the most part, however, first thoughts are treated as
better than second, and it may actually be the case that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>
alike in ancient and modern books, the too fastidious and
wavering ancient poet, or playwright, or essayist has
done himself in maturer years an injustice by blotting
the fresh impulses of his noviciate. It is a case, perhaps,
where the public is entitled to intervene, and taking the
two readings, deliver its award&mdash;always supposing that
the text is that of a man worth the pains, and, again,
that both versions are the language of the author, not
that of the editor. It is obvious that, as a matter of
literary and scientific or technical completeness, the last
edition of a work is the most desirable; but it is particularly
the case with volumes endeared by personal associations,
such as Gilbert White's <i>Selborne</i>, that one prefers
the text as the author left it, even if one has to be at
the pains to consult a second publication for up-to-date
knowledge. The present point is one to which I have
adverted in an earlier place.</p>

<p>Apart from the collector, the first and the best impressions
of writers of importance, whose texts underwent
at their own hands more or less material changes, are
necessarily an object of research to the editor or specialist
who has dedicated his attention to such or such a study;
and he is apt to pursue the matter still further than the
amateur, who does not, as a rule, esteem the intermediate
issues. It is this feeling and need which have led, since
critical and comparative editions came into fashion, to
the accumulation by their superintendents of an exhaustive
array of titles and dates, with hints of the most remark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>able
various readings; and the cause of bibliography has
gained, whether, in drawing together the series, the book-hunter
or the literary worker be the pioneer. From the
editorial and bibliographical points of view a complete
sequence of the writings of our more distinguished and
durable authors is generally practicable; but of excessively
popular or favourite books, even of the Elizabethan era,
it is imperfect. We refer to such cases as the so far
unseen second impression of Shakespeare's <i>Passionate
Pilgrim</i> and the ostensible disappearance of the original
quarto of <i>Love's Labor's Lost</i>.</p>

<p>Two questions connected with the present part of the
subject before us, now better understood and managed,
were under the old system, so far as we can ascertain or
judge, permitted to remain in a very loose and vague
state. We allude to the law of copyright and the revision
for the press. Prior to the institution of the Stationers'
Company and the existence of a Register, the sole protection
for authors and publishers was by the grant of a
privilege or a monopoly for a term of years; yet even
when registration had become compulsory, and was
supposed to be effectual, spurious editions constantly
found their way into the market, while books of which
the writers might desire, on various grounds, to keep the
MSS. in their own hands, found their way into print
through some irregular channel. Such was the case with
Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>, 1603, and (in a somewhat different
way) with the third edition of his <i>Passionate Pilgrim</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[<a href="./images/177.png">177</a>]</span>
1612; and we perceive that of Bacon's <i>Essays</i> during
some years two parallel impressions were current without
ostensible interference or warrant. There are frequent
instances in which authors state that their motive in
hastening into type was the rumour that a surreptitious
and inaccurate text was threatened, as if there was no
legal power to prevent such a class of piracy.</p>

<p>The correction of proofs by early writers, if we except
books of reference, and those not without qualification,
was evidently very lax and precarious. The entire body
of popular literature, the drama included, offers the
appearance, when we investigate examples, of having been
left to the mercy of the typographers, and the faulty
readings of old plays are more readily susceptible of
explanation from the fact that we owe their survival in
a printed form as often as not to the clandestine sale of
the prompters' copies to the stationer. The editors of our
dramatists have consequently found it an extremely
laborious task to restore the sense of corrupt passages,
and have sometimes abandoned the attempt in despair.
Not a few of the pieces in the last edition of Dodsley
come within this category; and we may signalise the
unique tragedy of <i>Appius and Virginia</i>, 1575, as a
prodigy of negligent and ignorant execution on the part
of the original compositor. But to the same cause is
due our still remaining uncertainty as to the true reading
of numerous places in Shakespeare himself.</p>

<p>Our collectors, however, are not particularly solicitous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[<a href="./images/178.png">178</a>]</span>
to study the present aspect of the matter, and the hunter
for First Editions is by no means likely to care an iota
about the purity of the text, but may be more apt to
congratulate himself on the ownership of the genuine old
copy with all the errors of the press as vouchers for its
character. Who would exchange a second <i>Hamlet</i> of
1604 for a first one of 1603, simply because the former
happens to contain as much more, and the latter is little
better than a <i>torso</i>?</p>

<p>The long uncertainty and insecurity of authors' rights,
whatever may be thought of the present position of the
matter, led at a very early date to the adoption of such
safeguards against plagiarism as it was in the power of
specialists, at all events, to impose. Some time after its
original publication in 1530, we find John Palsgrave,
compiler of the <i>Eclaircissement de la Langue Fran&ccedil;oise</i>,
prohibiting the printer from giving or selling copies to
any one without his leave, lest his profits as a teacher
of the language should be prejudicially affected; and so
it was that preceptors often reserved the right of sale,
and dealt direct with buyers, and in one case (only a
sample) a treatise on Shorthand by Richard Weston
(1770) is delivered to purchasers at eighteenpence on the
express condition that they shall not allow the book to
leave their own hands or premises.</p>

These are three forms of competition, which represent
as many sources of danger and disappointment to the
inexperienced. When we refer to illustrated books we of
course signify books with woodcuts and other graphic embellishments
from the earliest period, such as the Block
Books, the <i>Game and Play of the Chess</i>, the Caxton <i>&AElig;sop</i>,
the <i>N&uuml;rnberg Chronicle</i>, 1493, the <i>Poliphilo</i>, 1499, the
<i>Ship of Fools</i>, 1497, and the <i>Dance of Death</i>; collections
of Portraits and Views; down to the productions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[<a href="./images/180.png">180</a>]</span>
the modern school, and comprising the popular abridgments
of Crouch or Burton, of which an idea may be
gained from the list printed at the end of Bliss's <i>Reliqui&aelig;
Hearnian&aelig;</i>, 1857, and the cheap editions of romances and
story-books brought out by sundry stationers at prices
ranging from threepence to a penny in the closing years
of the seventeenth century. In the English series, independently
of the woodcuts which incidentally occur in
the books printed by Caxton and his immediate successors
and the <i>Emblem</i> series, there are Roeslin's <i>Birth
of Mankind</i>, by Raynald, 1540, Braun's <i>Civitates Orbis
Terrarum</i>, Gemini's <i>Anatomy</i>, 1545, Godet's <i>Genealogy
of all the Kings of England</i>, 1563, Saxton's <i>Maps</i>,
Holinshed's <i>Chronicles</i>, 1577, Harington's <i>Ariosto</i>, 1591,
Holland's <i>Baziologia</i>, 1618, and <i>Her&ouml;ologia</i>, 1620, the
various works illustrated by Pass, Elstracke, Hollar,
Barlow, and others, Vicars's <i>England's Worthies</i>, 1645,
Ricraft's <i>Survey of England's Champions</i>, 1647, and
other publications by Ricraft with engravings, till we
come down to the pictorial histories of England by
Bishop White, Kennett, and Rapin and Tindal, Pine's
<i>Horace</i>, and Buck's <i>Views</i>. No doubt among these there
are interesting specimens for the respective periods. It
is noticeable that in the Holinshed of 1577 the illustrations
are frequently repeated without regard to the context.
The engravings by Hollar and Barlow are the
most pleasing. But the <i>Basiliologia</i>, 1618, is the rarest
book in the whole range of this class of literature. Pine's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[<a href="./images/181.png">181</a>]</span>
<i>Horace</i>, even in the first edition, 1733, with the <i>Post
Est</i> reading, is common enough; and it has been found
uncut. So far as we are concerned, we should prefer it
in the original morocco. As a text it is of no account.</p>

<p>Coming lower down, we may specify or emphasise a
few <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i>, such as Hogarth's Prints in the first
or best states, Turner's <i>Liber Studiorum</i>, Sir Joshua
Reynolds' Graphic Works, and Lodge's <i>Portraits</i>. But
we are neither so wealthy nor so advanced as our French
and German neighbours in this direction, and the former
may be affirmed to stand alone in the possession of a
class of books with engravings germane to the national
genius and to the feeling and spirit of the time which
produced such masterpieces in their way. Of works illustrated
by copper-plates, that by Roeslin on Midwifery,
1540, above-named, seems to be the first in chronological
order; but both this and the Gemini of 1545 probably
owed their embellishments to foreign sources.</p>

<p>Our own country is probably weakest in this department;
many of the engravings in our early literature are
direct copies from the German, Dutch, or French masters;
the names of some of our leading artists are those of
foreigners; and we have comparatively little to show of
strictly original work till the last quarter of the eighteenth
century, when we may place our national efforts side by side
with uninterrupted Continental series from the middle
of the fifteenth. We are also poorly provided with books
of reference enabling amateurs to form an idea of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[<a href="./images/182.png">182</a>]</span>
extent of the field and of the relative practicability and
costliness of given classes or lines, whereas the foreign
collector enjoys the advantage of many excellent and
fairly trustworthy manuals. We want a General Guide
to English Illustrated Literature, which should exhibit its
sources and inspiration, and the epochs and schools into
which it is divisible.</p>

<p>Of course, it stands with the present description of
literary monuments as it does with the normal book. An
enterprise which should aim at being exhaustive would
prove excessively serious in point of outlay, and would
hardly be so satisfactory as one either on a miscellaneous
or a special principle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is desirable that statements offered in
catalogues of various kinds should aim at accuracy as
far as possible. It is singular what a vitality resides in
errors when they have been pointed out by experts, and
ought to be recognised. The auctioneers seem to keep
the type of certain notes standing, as they are repeated
in catalogue after catalogue without any other gain than
that of misleading such as know no better. One familiar
acquaintance of this class is the <i>dictum</i> that the copper-plates
in Hugh Broughton's <i>Concent of Scripture</i>, 1596,
are the earliest of the kind executed in England, although
they had not only been preceded by the prints in Harington's
<i>Ariosto</i>, 1591, but by those accompanying the
<i>Birth of Mankind</i> by Roeslin, 1540, and the <i>Anatomie
Delineatio</i> of Thomas Gemini, 1545.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[<a href="./images/183.png">183</a>]</span>
The average collector, who possesses tolerable judgment,
and has the authorities at his elbow, cannot go far
astray if he buys what pleases him among the ordinary
books of medium price, and may acquire examples of every
period and place of origin, as opportunities arise. Or he may
limit himself to early German, Dutch, Italian, or French
books with woodcuts, to the French illustrated literature
of the eighteenth century, to volumes with engravings by
Bewick, Stothard, or Bartolozzi, or to modern works with
proof-plates, etchings, and other choice varieties. It is
literally impossible to fix any <i>maximum</i> or <i>minimum</i> of
cost in this case; so much depends in graphic publications
on niceties of difference; and a law prevails here analogous
to that which governs the Print, that is to say, that
a more or less slight point of detail vitally affects values.
Let us take such a familiar instance as Lodge's <i>Portraits
of Illustrious Personages</i>. One may have a copy in Bohn's
Libraries for a dozen shillings; and one may give seventy
or eighty sovereigns for a large-paper copy with india
proofs of the four-volume folio edition of 1821. On the
whole, the twelve-volume quarto book is almost preferable,
as in the folio there is the disadvantage of three volumes
having copper-plates and one (the fourth) steel engravings,
and the quarto is obtainable for &pound;20 or &pound;25 in morocco.</p>

<p>Very few of the English portraits in the engraved
series antecedent to Lodge are trustworthy, as this branch
of specialism was not properly studied and understood
down to the present century, and even the heads executed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[<a href="./images/184.png">184</a>]</span>
by Houbraken are not unfrequently apocryphal. Such
a criticism applies less to royal personages than to private
individuals, of whom the painted likenesses were apt, after
the lapse of years, to be not so easily identifiable.</p>

<p>We have excellent monographs on Bewick and Bartolozzi
by Mr. Hugo and Mr. Tuer respectively; and there
is the delightful biography of Stothard by Mrs. Bray, 1851,
with profuse illustrations of his various artistic productions
and progressive style. Many of the scarcer examples
of Bartolozzi have been imitated. To the collector who
limits his interest to artists in book-shape, the first editions
on large or largest paper of the <i>Birds</i>, <i>Quadrupeds</i>, and
<i>Select Fables</i> of Bewick are most familiar and most desirable.
Stothard is seen to advantage in the engravings
to Ritson's <i>English Songs</i>, 1783. Much of his work lies
outside the mere library. For a general view of that
branch of the subject, Jackson and Chatto's <i>Treatise on
Wood Engraving</i>, 1839, may be recommended, so far as
the printed book is concerned.</p>

<p>We do not dwell on the modern illustrated literature,
which demands less study, and offers few features of
interest, especially that produced at home. Too large
a proportion of it, however, whatever may be the origin,
is indifferent in quality and permanent worth. Publications
are at present, like other commodities, prepared
with a main eye to sale; the sense of pride and honour
on the part of the producer is dulled; he manufactures
in gross. There are the showy volumes of Yriate on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[<a href="./images/185.png">185</a>]</span>
Venice, Florence, and other subjects, with letterpress
written apparently to accompany blocks and plates in
the publisher's warehouse.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if we seek something more elevated and
creditable, it will be in certain periodicals conducted on
higher lines than those to which the ordinary publisher
has from financial exigencies to be bound; and of these
there are several both in France and England&mdash;nay, in
Italy, in Australia.</p>

<p>The Illustrated Book, as we are familiar with it here,
affords innumerable examples of varied treatment, as the
school of design and the public taste differ or fluctuate
from century to century, from age to age, and even from
season to season. We do not speak of the cheaper literature
in this class, accompanied by engravings so intolerably
poor as to disarm criticism, but to the higher efforts of
the artist to respond to the author, and to appeal more
directly to the eye. In this country, however, we have
not so far been so fortunate, or otherwise, as to attain
the Continental ideal of what the graphic portion of a
literary performance should be; and the question is intimately
associated, particularly in France and among
foreign buyers of the French school, who are numerous
in all parts of the world, with that of binding, inasmuch
as a volume possessing pictorial embellishments of whatever
kind must fulfil all requirements in that respect
no less than in the outward vesture, and what may be
termed the complemental book-plate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span>
One of the eighteenth-century French productions
which answers most thoroughly to the just foregoing
description, is the "Fermiers G&eacute;n&eacute;raux" edition of the
<i>Contes et Nouvelles</i> of La Fontaine, 2 vols. 8vo, 1762.
The ordinary copies of this work, of which the whole
charm lies in the meretricious plates by Eisen (for the text
is inoffensive enough), are distinguished by the presence
or otherwise of two or three plates in a particular state,
those left as originally printed being preferred, because
they offer certain unconventional details subsequently
modified. But, in fact, to make a perfect exemplar of
the work, to satisfy the demand of a rigid connoisseur,
you have to combine features in the shape of proofs
before letters and vignettes taken off separately, besides
extra engravings by other artists not strictly belonging
to the edition, until you have a complete album of <i>bijoux
indiscrets</i>, and in the old French morocco by Derome or
Bozerian a &pound;200 lot. The Earl of Crawford's copy,
which was to have been sold at Sotheby's in July 1896
(No. 493 of catalogue), was a masterpiece of this description;
but it was withdrawn. It has since been sold to
another noble lord&mdash;the Earl of Carnarvon.</p>

<p>A copy of the normal <i>decouvert</i> type of the <i>Contes et
Nouvelles</i>, 1762, may be had, according to condition and
binding, for between &pound;10 and &pound;50. It has been said of
the extra plates to the <i>Contes et Nouvelles</i> of La Fontaine
that their rejection as part of the published work
ought to be a matter neither of surprise nor of regret,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[<a href="./images/187.png">187</a>]</span>
for they are not only flagrantly indecent, but are poor
and unsatisfying from an artistic point of view. Another
favourite edition of the <i>Tales</i> is that with the plates by
Romeyn de Hooge, 1685, 2 vols. 8vo; but you must
have it on fine paper in old morocco.</p>

<p>Looking at the illustrated editions of the <i>Tales</i>
generally, the plates, except the charming head and tail
pieces, do great injustice to the text, which the author
can hardly have foreseen the possibility of being deformed
and discredited by such forced and exaggerated
constructions of his meaning.</p>

<p>The edition of La Fontaine's <i>Fables</i> by Oudry, 4
vols. folio, 1755-59, is almost equally sought by connoisseurs,
though on somewhat different grounds. Some
copies in one of the plates, where there is a tavern sign,
have on the board a lion rampant. In the Biblioth&egrave;que
at Paris is a copy on largest paper bound for Marie
Antoinette with original decorations by Oudry himself
on the covers; it is only a single book out of thousands
which they have there, yet it might make a day's sale,
and a remunerative one, in Wellington Street in the
Strand! Boccaccio, 5 vols. 8vo, 1757, with plates by
Eisen, Gravelot, and others, enters into this series; it is
not an uncommon book, and is found with a French and
an Italian text, of which the former is generally preferred.
It is necessary to secure a copy in all respects faultless.
But far more important and relatively costly are the
<i>Baisers</i> of Dorat, 1770, printed on <i>grand papier de</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>
<i>Hollande</i>, with the title in red and black, and, above
all, Laborde's <i>Choix de Chansons</i>, 1773, always a dear
publication when the state is right, and excessively
difficult to obtain with proof plates; the Magniac copy
was bought by Mr. Quaritch at Phillips's a few years
since for upwards of &pound;200, and sold by him, we believe,
to Lord Carnarvon. Another copy, with the plates in
unlettered proof state, is marked &pound;250 in Pearson &amp; Co.'s
Catalogue, 1897-98. <i>La Folle Journ&eacute;e</i>, by Beaumarchais,
with engravings of the same period and character, is
also a charming production, and commands a good
price.</p>

<p>The minuti&aelig; into which the enthusiasts for the
graphic French literature produced in the closing years
of the ancient r&eacute;gime permit themselves to enter is rather
bewildering to a novice or an outsider, and certainly asks
as much study as it can well be worth. The cultivation
of the pursuit has naturally brought into existence a
small library of monographs, of which that by Cohen is
one of the best known and the most frequently quoted.
There is an equal degree of difference between the pictorial
features of books produced in England and on
the Continent during the past and the present centuries.
In France there still reigns the spirit of enterprise conducive
to the execution of high-class work; but among
ourselves it is painful to contemplate the decline, not of
power, but of encouragement, and the unhealthy tendency
to a style of illustration which will not probably be very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[<a href="./images/189.png">189</a>]</span>
creditable to the country in retrospect. A collection
of modern illustrated works of mixed origin may well
dispense, except by way of sample and contrast, with
much of the fantastic and preposterous creations of some
of the latter-day masters.</p>

<p>The <i>Edition de Luxe</i>, the <i>Large</i>, <i>Larger</i>, and <i>Largest
Paper</i>, the copy on yellow paper, blue paper, writing
paper, on <i>papier de Hollande</i>, <i>de Chine</i>, or <i>d'Inde</i>, or on
Japanese vellum, the very limited impression, are among
the fancies and demands of the omnivorous past. A
short study of the supplement to Bonn's <i>Lowndes</i> and of
Martin's <i>Privately Printed Books</i> will suffice to show that
not only a library, but a tolerably extended one, might
be formed of these classes of literature exclusively; and
indeed the thing has been more than once actually done.
Utterson, Halliwell, Laing, Maidment, Eyton, Turnbull,
and others have contributed to leave to us a voluminous
inheritance of now rather neglected and undervalued curiosities
of this kind. But even here the discriminating
collector may still advantageously pick out items worth
buying and holding, for in the case of every artificial
<i>furore</i> the good, bad, and indifferent are apt to rise and
to fall together, while it is reserved only for the first to
experience a revival&mdash;the Revival of the Fittest.</p>

<p>The Illustrated Copy is an indefinite quantity as to
character and importance or estimation, since no two
correspond. Nearly all those which have been formed
are more or less unequal, even where there has been no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>
regard to cost, and every care has been exercised in the
selection of objects; for there is a chronic tendency to
become complete. But so far as the normal undertaking
of this class is concerned, we usually perceive a few
desirable and appropriate prints or drawings as a sort
of <i>pi&egrave;ce de resistance</i>, and the remainder is made up
anyhow. Even such a book as the Pennant's <i>London</i> in
the Huth Collection strikes us as unsatisfactory on the
ground stated; there is a share of merit in the choice of
embellishments; there is also too considerable a residuum
of comparative rubbish; and if it is so here, the reader
may judge how the matter stands with illustrated books
of the ordinary stamp made up for sale. There is one
remark to be offered. The really fine prints and other
similar productions are too valuable to treat in this way,
as they would necessarily render the work, when it was
ready for the client, too expensive. A Pennant, for
example, exclusively composed of first-rate material,
and tolerably representative in regard to names and
localities, would be worth thousands of pounds. The
time for securing prizes for this purpose at a moderate
figure has gone by. The catalogues advertise copies
"extensively and tastefully" illustrated with hundreds or
thousands of portraits and views; and the bidding or
demand, as the case may be, is carried to &pound;20, &pound;50, or
&pound;100. Our advice is, Not to touch. It is preferable to
have a few chosen examples in a portfolio.</p>

<p>It is not always that the Illustrated Copy is restricted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[<a href="./images/191.png">191</a>]</span>
to engravings and other works of art. Autograph letters
enter into the plan, and facsimiles of title-pages or other
cognate and more or less relevant objects. One of the
most recent enterprises of this nature&mdash;a Boswell's <i>Johnson</i>&mdash;cost
the actual possessor about &pound;10,000; it was extended
to forty-two volumes, and aimed at having a token
of some kind of every one mentioned in the text. So we
advance. It was deemed a piece of extravagance when,
forty or fifty years ago, the late Sir William Stirling-Maxwell
expended about &pound;1000 in forming an illustrated
copy of his own <i>Cloister Life of Charles V.</i></p>

<p>The Nature-printing, Autotype, Photogravure, Collotype,
and other processes strike us as hardly falling
within the category here contemplated, although that
they are material accessions to our resources is undoubted.
They are the fruit of a combination between nature and
mechanical science; their fidelity for portraiture and
technical purposes may be granted; but they do not
realise the notion of artistic embellishment or interpretation,
nor are they capable of rendering with anything
approaching truth the more delicate and subtle touches
of the miniaturist.</p>

<p>The <i>Edition de Luxe</i> is dilettantism <i>in extremis</i>. It
is a movement which seems to rest on a false theory and
basis. It should have limited itself to <i>nug&aelig; literari&aelig;</i>, to
<i>bagatelles</i>, which no mortal sought to read, and which
might be harmlessly printed on any material, of any
latitude and longitude, in any type, or else to graphic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<a href="./images/192.png">192</a>]</span>
works where the luxury would more comfortably and
more suitably make itself manifest in illustrations varied
and duplicated to whatever extent it pleased the issuer,
or was calculated to gratify his clients. But to apply
the principle to books so essentially appealing to
practical readers as Dickens, Thackeray, Scott, and
others, was an unfortunate step and precedent, which
has thrown on the market a large amount of stock not
easily moved even at a heavy discount on the published
price.</p>

<p>Merely looking at the <i>bibliophile</i> pure and simple, and
shutting our eyes to those phases of book-collecting,
where the principle or sole aim is educational or religious,
we incline to the conclusion that foreigners, and above
all the French, are less practical than ourselves, and lay
far greater stress on sentiment.</p>

<p>The French, and we may perhaps add the Anglo-French
school of book-collecting, works on lines which
to a normal lover of books must at first appear rather
mysterious and strange, if not absolutely irrational. The
closest analogy which it is in our power to suggest is the
almost parallel sentiment and policy in regard to other
branches of inquiry&mdash;china, furniture, numismatics. The
Frenchman and his English disciple have no respect whatever
as <i>collectionneurs</i> for substantial value, and agree in
ignoring everything, good, bad, indifferent, outside a
prescribed limit.</p>

<p>The temper of the foreign markets, especially the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[<a href="./images/193.png">193</a>]</span>
French one, is so essentially different from that of
England, that it demands an almost life-long study of
the subject to comprehend the true principles by which
they are guided and influenced. In what we are just now
urging, we must of course be understood to allude to the
<i>amateur</i> pure and simple,&mdash;in fact, if it may be said without
offence, to the virtuoso. There are foreign book-collectors,
as there are English, who seek copies of works
within their lines, whatever those lines may be, for the
sake of information and reference. The collector has no
such aim. He aspires to make himself master of so many
items answering to certain inexorable postulates laid
down by the experts in such matters. His taste has
happened to take a bibliographical direction and shape;
it is hardly a literary one; and the objects of his pursuit,
instead of being pictures, prints, antiquities, gems, or
coins, are things in book-form.</p>

<p>Monsieur and his British satellite cultivate exclusively
what is French, just as in the numismatic department
Monsieur will only buy French coins or Franco-Italian
ones, or the money of Monsieur's direct ancestors, the
Greeks and Romans. It is the same principle throughout;
and the undoubted fact is before us that, if the article
to be sold is right in all respects, the price is marvellous.
One can understand a high appreciation of some superb
or unique example of ancient typography, of a book which
has belonged to a famous person, or of a manuscript like
the <i>Bedford Missal</i> or the <i>Hours</i> of Anne of Brittany.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>
One can understand, again, the enthusiasm for an unrecorded
old poem, romance, or play, for a production
by an eminent author supposed to have perished, or for
a precious relic such as the Manesse MS., presented
by the German Emperor Frederic to the library at
Heidelberg, from which it had been taken by the French
during the wars of the Revolution. But the Parisian
<i>go&ucirc;t</i> is less intent on such matters than on flimsy
and effeminate specialities. A copy of a book, it does
not signify how valuable intrinsically it may be, is
worth nothing in the eyes of <i>Monsieur</i> and <i>Monsieur
d'Angleterre son ami</i>, unless it is in a particular vesture,
with a particular <i>ex libris</i>, and of a particular measurement
in <i>millesimes</i>. <i>MM. les amateurs</i> reject not merely
calf, but that vellum wrapper and that stitched paper
envelope so dear to us English&mdash;so dear that when one
of us has given hundreds of pounds for a book thus
clothed, rather than commit it to a binder, we employ
him to make us a case for the gem. The volume of
tracts which Charles I. borrowed of Thomason the
stationer, and let fall in the mud, what could Monsieur
do with it? Absolutely nothing. But the British
Museum cherishes the relic, and would not on any
account, we solemnly believe, suffer the stains to be
removed. They are the credentials, the link between
the king and ourselves.</p>

bindings we shall have more to say below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> may be treated as the casual accessories of books
of nearly all periods and countries&mdash;the autograph inscription
testifying to the ownership or signalising a gift from
one possessor to another&mdash;have manifold and diversified
elements of interest and attraction. These features offer
a graduated scale of importance, just as it happens. The
question depends on the donor, or the recipient, or the
article given and received; and where all these combine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[<a href="./images/196.png">196</a>]</span>
to augment the charm and to complete the spell, the issue
is electrifying. No more impressive corroboration of this
truth could well be desired or produced than the Henry
VIII. <i>Prayer-Book</i> of 1544 on vellum, from the Fountaine
Collection, with the MSS. notes and autographs of the King,
the Princess Mary, Prince Edward, and Queen Catherine
Parr. It fetched about 600 guineas at Christie's in 1894.</p>

<p>In the <i>Bibliographer</i>, <i>Bookworm</i>, and his own <i>Collections</i>,
the writer has formerly assembled together notices
of all the most remarkable examples of English books,
both printed and in MS., with inscriptions, <i>marginalia</i>,
and other records of prior and successive possession,
brought within his reach during more than thirty years
past. There are not unreasonably people who may not
see in an ordinary copy of a volume much tangible
interest, yet who are prepared to recognise the value, and
even importance, of one with the autograph and memoranda
of some illustrious personage, of some great warrior
or statesman, or of a famous man of letters, artist, or
sculptor. The accidental and secondary feature in the
work takes precedence of the rest; he pays for the sentiment
and association. The direct human interest resident
in such a relic is apt, in the opinion of many, to surpass
that of the finest binding; for one has here the very
characters traced long ago by the holder; one can
imagine him (or her) seated at the table engaged in the
task of leaving to the times to come this memento. The
book is the casual receptacle; perchance in itself it is of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[<a href="./images/197.png">197</a>]</span>
inconsiderable worth; but the manuscript accessions are
as an embalmment and a sanctification. The copy is not
as others; it has descended to us as a part of a precious
inheritance, of which the mere paper and print are the
least significant; we are to approach and touch it reverently,
as if the individual to whom it appertained were
standing by, to reprove an ungentle hand and take back
the legacy.</p>

<p>It would be barely possible, were it of essential use,
to schedule all the existing presentation or annotated
copies of books in our own and other literatures, but we
shall here make an effort to offer a general view of what
is intended, and what may in some instances become
attainable by watching opportunities:&mdash;</p>

</ul>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[<a href="./images/198.png">198</a>]</span>
Monastic inscriptions are generally limited in their
interest to casual light shed by them on personages
connected with the institution or on some local circumstance.</p>

<p>Of royal books, genuine and otherwise, the number
has had a tendency to increase through the successive
dispersion of old libraries everywhere, combined with the
additional facilities for gaining access to those which still
remain intact. The Henry VIII. <i>Prayer-Book</i> on vellum
is the only copy known in any state of the edition of
1544, and may not have been publicly issued with this
date.</p>

<p>Some of the royal memoranda are of signal interest
and curiosity. On the back of the title, under the royal
arms, the king himself says: "Remember thys wrighter
wen you doo pray for he ys yours noon can saye naye.
Henry R." At the passage: "I have not done penance
for my malice," the same hand inserts in the margin:
"trewe repentance is the best penance;" and farther
on he makes a second marginal note on the sentence:
"thou hast promysed forgyveness," . . . "repentance
beste penance." This was a sort of family common-place
book. Inside the cover Prince Edward (afterward
Edward VI.) writes: "I will yf you will." The volume,
which contains other matter of great historical value,
appears to have been given by Henry VIII. shortly before
his death to his daughter Mary; for on a small piece of
vellum inside the cover he has written: "Myne owne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[<a href="./images/199.png">199</a>]</span>
good daughter I pray you remember me most hartely
when you in your prayere do shew for grace to be attayned
assurydly to yr lovyng fader Henry R." The Princess
subsequently gave it to her stepmother, Catherine Parr,
and it has a motto and signature of that lady's second
husband, Lord Seymour of Sudeley, the Admiral.</p>

<p>The old king, we observe, grew rather nervous about
the future just at the last, and he at all events admitted
that there was room for contrition.</p>

<p>A companion volume and monument was the copy of
the Sarum <i>Hor&aelig;</i> of 1520, printed on vellum, in the second
portion of the Ashburnham sale. This precious book
belonged to the Parr family, including the mother of
Queen Katherine Parr, and at any rate contained an
inscription in the hand of the Queen's brother, and of
those of members of the Carew, Vaux, Tailboys, Nevill,
and other families, besides being in beautiful condition;
and the same library yielded a second copy of <i>Hours</i>,
1512, which had passed through the hands of Henry
VIII. himself, as attested in one place by his autograph
memorandum: "Pray yow pray for me your loving
cousin Henry Rex." Such relics appear to bring back
before us the dead players on the human stage, divested
of all but their more redeeming characteristics.</p>

<p>In the British Museum we have the <i>Great Bible</i> of
1540 on vellum, which enters into the present category by
reason of its association with the same prince, though in
a different way. On the reverse of the fly-leaf occurs:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="./images/200.png">200</a>]</span>
"This Booke is presented vnto your most excellent highnesse
by youre loving, faithfull, and obedient subiect and
daylye Oratour, Anthonye Marler, of London, Haberdassher."
Truly a gift worthy of a king; and there it remains,
a precious link with the past and a splendid memorial of
the citizen of London who laid it at his sovereign's feet.</p>

<p>Propriety and sympathy of costume go very far indeed
to establish and augment the estimation of printed
volumes with manuscript tokens of former proprietorship.
The collector who chooses this field of activity has
to weigh the correlation and harmony between the volume
itself and the individual or individuals to whom
it once appertained. We have usually to content ourselves
with the interest resident in an autograph, with
or without further particulars; it is a book, perhaps,
which formed part of the library of a distinguished
Elizabethan or Jacobean writer or public character; but,
if it were not, its worth might be nominal. Again,
the book is possibly one of great value, and exhibits an
early autograph and MSS. notes; it would be better without
them. Find the copy of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, 1593,
given by Shakespeare to Lord Southampton, the poet's
copy of the <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, 1590-96, Sir Fulke Greville's
copy of Sydney's <i>Arcadia</i>, 1590, or a book of Voyages
belonging to Drake or Raleigh, and it is worth a library,
and a good one too. The nearest approach we have yet
made to this kind of combination is the first folio Montaigne
and the original edition of Lord Brooke's works,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
1633, with the signature of Jonson, and the Spenser of
1679 with the notes of Dryden, unless the <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, 1667, with Milton's presentation to a bookbinder
at Worcester be authentic.</p>

<p>We must not omit in the present connection the copy
of the prose story-book of <i>Howleglas</i>, given in 1578 with
others by Edmund Spenser to Gabriel Harvey. But an
almost equally covetable possession was the copy just
referred to of Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, 1667, which occurred
only the other day at a sale, where it was, as too often
happens, mis-described, and brought &pound;70. It bore on a
small slip inlaid in a fly-leaf: "For my loving ffreind, Mr.
Francis Rea, Booke binder in Worcester these," and on
another piece of paper: "Presented me by the Author to
whom I gave two doubl sovereigns" = &pound;4, nearly as much
as the poet had for the copyright. The story of the
book is unknown to us; it seems eminently likely that the
first memorandum was written by Milton; but whether it
belonged to a wrapper forwarding the gift, or to a letter
accompanying it, is problematical.</p>

<p>Rea of Worcester must be the same individual who is
described as having re-bound in June 1660 the Jolley
and Ashburnham copy of Higden's <i>Polychronicon</i>, printed
by Caxton, 1482; but there an earlier owner, Richard
Furney, calls him "one Rede of Worcester."</p>

<p>At Trinity, Cambridge, there is the edition of
Spenser, 1679, with a memorandum on the fly-leaf by Jacob
Tonson, testifying to the MSS. notes in the book being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[<a href="./images/202.png">202</a>]</span>
by Dryden, and at Wootton formerly was the <i>Fa&euml;ry
Queen</i>, 1596, John Evelyn's cypher in gold down the back
of the cover and seventeen lines in his autograph on the
fly-leaf.</p>

<p>Among our dramatists, Ben Jonson is conspicuous by
the number of copies of his own performances which
he presented to royal and noble personages or to private
friends. Of three gift-copies of his <i>Volpone</i>, 1607,
one has an inscription to John Florio, the other to
Henry Lambton of Lambton. The almost unique large-paper
one of <i>Sejanus</i>, 1605, in the Huth Collection, was
given to the poet's "perfect friend," Francis Crane. In
the Museum are the <i>Masque of Queens</i> and the <i>Masque
of Blackness and Beauty</i> offered to the queen of James I.
But of Shakespeare, Beaumont and Fletcher, and many
others, we have not a single memorial of this kind. Of
Massinger there is one: the copy of his <i>Duke of Milan</i>,
1623, received from him by Sir F. Foljambe. In the case
of Taylor the water-poet, the nearest approach to anything
of the sort is the MS. note of the recipient of a copy
of his Works, 1630.</p>

<p>Of two equally prominent poets of the same epoch,
Daniel and Drayton, the latter seems to have had a
partiality for inscribing his autograph in presentation
copies of his books, while of Daniel in this way we do not
recollect to have met with a single example.</p>

<p>Very engaging, on account of its manly and cordial
tone, is the autograph epistle by Sir Richard Fanshawe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[<a href="./images/203.png">203</a>]</span>
accompanying an extant copy of his translation of
Guarini's <i>Faithful Shepherd</i>, 1648. The whole production
may be seen in the Huth Catalogue (p. 633), where we
inserted it as a favourable sample of this kind of poetry
or verse. The lines are headed: "To my deare friend
Mr. Tho. Brooke with Pastor Fido before an entended
voyage," and commence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"This to the man I most affect I send,</p>
<p class="ihalf">The faithfull Shepherd to as true a friend.</p>
<p class="ihalf">There on each page thou'lt tenderest passion see,</p>
<p class="ihalf">But none more tender than my own for thee."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The volume belongs to the series of memorials, which we
possess in not too ample abundance, of the regard entertained
by men of letters of former days for each other, or
for their intimates, and ranks with the priceless copies of
his own books presented by Jonson to some of his distinguished
contemporaries. If he, or any one else, made
gifts of such things to the greatest of them all, every trace
of such an incident has apparently disappeared.</p>

<p>Rarity of occurrence is not by any means an imperative
feature in influencing or determining the value of
inscriptions. No examples are probably more abundant
than the books of Izaak Walton, either with an ordinary
note of presentation, or with MSS. notes in the writer's
hand, if not with both; yet they invariably command a
liberal price from the admission of Walton by common
acknowledgment into the select circle of literary men,
whose works we love for the sake of the author.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[<a href="./images/204.png">204</a>]</span>
The following inscription in contemporary MS. occurs
on the reverse of the Old Testament title to a Cranmer's
Bible of 1540: "Thys byble ys John Crogdens, Cytyzen
and merchant taylor of London, dwellynge in Wattlynge
Street at y<sup>e</sup> syne of Y<sup>e</sup> Whyte Horse, 1550."</p>

<p>Occasionally more or less curious personal traits or
family clues are yielded by the memoranda on fly-leaves.
A Latin Testament of 1563 bears: "e libris Thom&aelig;
Northcote e dono Joh. Rolle Armig. de Stephenstone in
agro Devoniensi;" a copy of Jewell's Sermons, 1583, has
"John Willoughby, 1591," and "Amor vincit omnia."
In the Savile copy of Sir Thomas More's Works, 1557,
we read: "de dono H. Savile anno 1600; found by Mary
Savile, Dec. 12, 1635, amongst other books at Metheby:
for my daughter Mary Savile."</p>

<p>If the reader will cross over with us into Scotland for
a moment or so, we will introduce him to a very interesting
relic in the shape of a Latin Aristotle of 1526, in which
a Cistercian monk of Kinloss Abbey, Andrew Langland,
has enshrined two metrical compositions from his own
pen; an epitaph on the Regent Murray, and an epistle
to Joannes Ferrerius, Professor at Kinloss, 1542, and
continuator of Hector Boece. The epitaph is dialogue-wise
between the Bishop of Orkney, who was absent from
the funeral, and Ferrerius, who attended it.</p>

<p>At the sale of the library of the Duke of Leeds, a large-paper
copy of Wycherley's <i>Miscellany Poems</i>, 1704, apparently
given by the poet to Lord Treasurer Danby,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[<a href="./images/205.png">205</a>]</span>
produced the outrageous price of &pound;46. A far more
interesting example was that which he presented to
Mistress Mary Twysden, as noticed in the <i>Bibliographer</i>.
A more important souvenir was the Latin Testament
given by Pope to Bolingbroke in 1728 (Christie's, April 3,
1895, No. 339); and a yet stronger sympathy must be
felt with the Juvenal and Persius, 8vo, Amsterdam, 1684,
which once belonged to T. Killigrew, and subsequently to
Pope, whose English version occupies the interleaves, if
the description given by Wake of Derby be correct, as the
book itself we have not seen.</p>

<p>We approach a different class of consideration when we
leave behind us the more or less factitious and artificial
attractions of early bindings and autograph memoranda,
and pass to books which owe their extrinsic interest to
a mere signature, as in the case of the copy of Florio's
<i>Montaigne</i>, 1603, which belonged to Shakespeare, and
possesses his autograph on the fly-leaf, and of which the
<i>provenance</i>, as stated by Madden in his pamphlet, 1838,
favours the authenticity; and again, in that of Mr. Collier's
copy of Drayton's <i>Shepheard's Garland</i>, 1593, which bears
on the title-page the signature of Robert, Earl of Essex.</p>

<p>There quite casually fell into our own hands a copy
of one of Archbishop Usher's books, a stray from Manchester,
with "Humfrey Chetham's Booke, 1644," on
fly-leaf, and with it came a MS. on vellum, also formerly
Chetham's, of the <i>Stimulus Conscienti&aelig;</i> in English verse.
They long lay in a garret at Pennington Hall, Leigh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>
Lancashire, the seat of the Hiltons, with whom Chetham
was intimate, if not connected.</p>

<p>We meet with a surprise now and then, as when such
a work as the English <i>Reynard the Fox</i> of 1681-84 carries
on its face a proof of the prior ownership of Beau Nash:
"Rich. Nash Arm. Bathoni&aelig;, 1761," but it is quite natural
to find the autograph of Sir Joshua Reynolds accompanying
a series of French plates illustrative of the <i>Odyssey</i>, 1639.</p>

<p>In old books, and in new ones too, there are inscriptions
and inscriptions. We are all familiar with the scrawl of
the clown, who has handed down to us his unconsecrated
name on the title-page or fly-leaf of some volume of ours
otherwise irreproachable. Just a step above him is your
fellow who writes some objurgatory <i>caveat</i> against the
malappropriator, and brings the Almighty without scruple
into the witness-box, in case any varlet should make free
with his property:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Hic liber est meus,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Testis est Deus;</p>
<p class="ihalf">Si quis me qu&aelig;rit,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Hic nomen erit."</p>
<p class="i4">"Will. Morsse, 1678."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of the whimsical entries in old English books the
diversity is endless. On the fly-leaf of a copy of Roger
Edgworth's <i>Sermons</i>, 4to, 1557, occurs: "Bryen O'rourke
his hand and writting by fore God and man." A singular
application of the Holy Scriptures presents itself
in a couple of <i>IOU</i>'s written by James Haig of Prettisides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[<a href="./images/207.png">207</a>]</span>
in Longwood, co. Wilts, on the back of the title to a
New Testament of 1584. There is a curious, almost
pathetic form of this habit of writing in books, practised
from very early days down to our own, when we may
easily remember how Lamb and Coleridge used to fill the
blank leaves of a work of common interest, as it kept
passing to and fro like a messenger, till the worth of the
manuscript matter left that of the printed far behind
indeed. In a mild kind of way this sort of thing was
already going on in the sixteenth century. A copy of the
English version of the <i>Paraphrase</i> of Erasmus on the New
Testament, 1548, passes similarly between two Tudor-period
intimates, and there is this: "Mr. Dunes, I woulde
wish you to peruse V. chapter of Marke, and there you
shall finde great comforte to your soules health. Thus
fare you well in the Lorde. Wyllyam Byrde."</p>

<p>In the copy of Shakespeare's <i>Passionate Pilgrim</i>, 1599,
bound up with an early edition of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, a
former owner represents with perfect justice, that although
he gave three-halfpence for the two volumes in one, a
corner of a leaf was defective; and there has been furthermore
a profound arithmetical computation that if this
gentleman and his heirs or assigns had invested the
amount in good securities, the capital at this moment
would have reached the vicinity of &pound;1000. In a copy of
Stow's <i>Survey</i>, 1633, which once belonged to Sir Thomas
Davies, Lord Mayor of London in 1676, we encounter a
memorandum on the fly-leaf: "I pray, put in the loose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span>
leaues Carefully. John Meriton. For Mr. Richardson,
bookbinder in Scalding Alley." Richardson bound for
Pepys. In an odd volume of <i>Sandford and Merton</i>,
which fell in Dr. Burney's way, and which he gave to his
daughter&mdash;Johnson's "little Burney"&mdash;he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"See, see, my dear Fan,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Here comes, spick and span,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Little Sandford and Merton,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Without stain or dirt on;</p>
<p class="ihalf">'Tis volume the second,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Than the first better reckoned;</p>
<p class="ihalf">Pray read it with glee,</p>
<p class="ihalf">And remember C. B.</p>
<p class="i4">"April 18, 1786."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Beauty has been said to depend on Variety, and so we
ought not to object to examples selected from widely
different sources.</p>

<p>Horace's <i>multa renascentur</i> comes into our mind
when we stumble on a remark by Wodhull the collector
in an <i>Acta Apostolorum</i> printed at Oxford in 1715:
"In May, 1810, Mr. Leigh, auctioneer, told me that a
copy of this edition had lately sold for &pound;20, observing,
'these are the times to sell books, not to buy them.'"
A more notable man, William Beckford, appears in a
copy of the original French <i>Vathek</i>, 1787, as the second
person of the drama by reason of the written matter
referring to him, and being in the hand of M. Chavannes
of Lausanne. The note occupies the whole of the
available space on the title, and is as follows:&mdash;"A la<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>

dus menacer M. Beckford de mettre dans les papiers son
infidelit&eacute; . . . et M. B. se hata de dedomager l'Imprimeur

<p>So far as books with the autographs and MSS. notes
of men of the modern school, such as Byron, Coleridge,
Lamb, and Shelley, are concerned, the opportunities for
securing specimens have certainly grown more numerous.
We have already in the places specified above furnished
many illustrations of this section, and they might be
readily extended.</p>

<p>In the foreign department there is a perfectly inexhaustible
store of material under a variety of heads:
evidences of ownership and descent, biographical suggestions,
historical links and side-lights, dated armorial <i>ex
libris</i>. In 1869 the author met with a thick 4to volume,
including the Cologne edition of the <i>Legenda Sancti Albani
Martyris</i>, printed about 1475, on the fly-leaf or cover
of which was a list of contents made in 1475; and
in the Hopetoun copy of the <i>Ethica</i> of Aristotle the
original owner had established the place of printing, otherwise
unspecified, by a MS. note, dated 1469, in which he
stated that the book was presented to him by its typographer,
"Johannes Mentelin Argentin."</p>

<p>In a copy of the works of Petrarch in Latin, folio,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[<a href="./images/210.png">210</a>]</span>
1501, occurs on the title: "Liber Antonij kressen juris
vtriusq. doctoris emptus venecijs ligatus nurenberge
Mcccccv;" and the noble old volume (now in the British
Museum) is accompanied by a memoir of Kressen, printed
about 1600, of uniform size, with a splendid portrait of
the interesting N&uuml;remberger.</p>

<p>A copy of the Vulgate of 1484 commands attention
from the presence of a coeval MS. note pasted on the
first leaf: "Hec Biblia est Petri Dominici Boninsegnis
qui a fratre Cosmo empta fuit Anno <span class="smcap">mcccclxxxu</span>.
xviii. die Februarii." A Latin <i>Hor&aelig;</i> of the fifteenth
century contains on a fly-leaf the ensuing little family
story: "Ces Heures apartiennent a Damoyselle Michelle
Du Der&egrave; Femme de M. Loys Dorleans Advocat en la
Court du Parlement et lesquelles luy sont echeu&eacute;s par la
succession de feu son p&egrave;re M. Jehan Duder&egrave; Conseiller
du Roy &amp; Auditeur en sa chambre des comptes 1577.
Amour &amp; Humilit&eacute; sont les deux liens de nostre
mariage." A St. Jerome's <i>Epistol&aelig;</i>, printed at Mainz
about 1470, is accompanied by the dated book-plate,
1595, of Christophorus Baro &agrave; Wolckhenstain.</p>

<p>In the French series the number of interesting items
from a personal or historical point of view, if not both, is
of course great, although, as a rule, French collectors
have been rather sparing as annotators of their literary
possessions. In a copy of De Bure's Sale Catalogue, 1786,
now in the Huth Library, occurs a peculiarly striking
exception, however, in the shape of a MS. note in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[<a href="./images/211.png">211</a>]</span>
handwriting of Louis XVI., only three years prior to the
fall of the Bastille, "Marquer les livres que je desire pour
moi."</p>

<p>In the Duke of Sussex's Library was a New Testament
in French presented by Josephine before her second
marriage to Napoleon. She had inscribed on the spare
leaf preceding title: "Au General Bonaparte ce Testament
Lutherain est present&eacute; de part la veuve Beauharnois,"
and below occurs in the illustrious recipient's
hand, <i>Buonaparte</i>. An association fully as historically
and personally significant appertains to the Voltaire's <i>Henriade</i>,
1770, in one of the volumes of which the to-be
Empress writes: "Donn&eacute; part Madame la Viscontesse de
Beauharnois: pensez &agrave; elle, aimez-la, n'oubliez jamais qu'elle
est v&ocirc;tre amie la plus attach&eacute;e." Was this an oblation
at the same shrine? But this is a slight digression, warranted
by the twofold circumstance that all these examples
have belonged to English collectors, and are of a class
quite as interesting to us as to those with whom they
are more immediately associated by origin. The same
may perhaps be said of the MS. sold in London in 1899,
formerly belonging to two persons so widely different as
Marie Antoinette and Robespierre, of the latter of whom
it possessed the autograph. The interest seemed to centre
in the signature of the Revolutionary leader.</p>

<p>The interest and respect with which the presence of
handwriting in books is regarded are indefinitely varied.
But the preponderance of worshippers is no doubt on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[<a href="./images/212.png">212</a>]</span>
the side of those who have shone in the <i>belles lettres</i> and
in society. Sovereigns, unless it be Frederic the Great or
Napoleon, Mary of Scotland or Marie Antoinette, generals,
politicians, professional men, do not go for much. The
competition is for the poet, the novelist, the newsmonger,
or some <i>enfant terrible</i>, whose autograph is rare to excess.
To be on thoroughly good posthumous terms with collectors,
one has no need to have been respectable, sober, benevolent,
or pious; these are rather in the nature of draw-backs;
but one must have possessed a strong personality.
That is the secret. Personality. Schedule the illustrious
of the past on this guiding principle, and you cannot err.
Men and women without infirmities, without vices, why,
ask any dealer of repute and experience, and he will tell
you that there is no call for their signatures or for their
correspondence. They have too much character in one
sense and too little in another. An autograph of Dick
Turpin or Claud Du Val would be worth a dozen of
Archdeacon Paley or even of Archbishop Tillotson.</p>

<p>The autograph collector certainly forms a separate
<i>genus</i>. He does not buy books. He does not affect MSS.
where they exceed the limits of a fly-leaf or title-page
entry. We are accustomed to criticise Master John
Bagford unkindly because he stripped the volumes of
their titles and then cast them away. But he lived a
long while ago, when the value and rarity of many of
these things were not so generally understood, and there
were not customers all over the Old and New Worlds as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>
many as one can tell on one's fingers to take an early book,
if it was offered to them. Even now it not seldom happens
that an exceedingly interesting signature or note accompanies
an item worth only so much per lb., and your
connoisseur in the autograph surrenders all but his
portion to its destiny. Who can gainsay him? He
shrugs his shoulders; he is no bookworm; he wants
autographs alone.</p>

<p>Exceptions to the governing principle arise, however,
and sometimes they are recognised, sometimes not.
The most beautiful examples for internal condition,
binding, even intrinsic interest, are occasionally sacrificed
to this Procrustes&mdash;this case-hardened Bagford of our
own day. Not so long since we remarked as a treasure
beyond our purse a copy of Donne's <i>Sermons</i>, with a
brilliant portrait of the author, and a long inscription
by Izaak Walton presenting the volume to his aunt. It
was in the pristine English calf binding, as clean as when
it left Walton's hands <i>en route</i> for his kinswoman, and
such a delightful signature. What has become of it?
It is sad even to commit to paper the story&mdash;one among
many. An American gentleman acquired it, tore the
portrait and leaf of inscription out, and threw the rest
away! Why, forsooth, should he keep a folio volume
against his inclination? He left that to whomsoever it
might chance to fall&mdash;a mangled corpse!</p>

<p>It is not peremptorily necessary, however, that there
should be witness in black on white to the prior holder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[<a href="./images/214.png">214</a>]</span>
of a literary <i>bijou</i>; for the external evidence may prove
abundantly adequate to the satisfaction of the most
sceptical. A binding is quite capable of serving as a
voucher and guarantee for the <i>provenance</i> of a printed
book or manuscript, provided that all the links in the
chain are sound. The Prayer-Book of Queen Henrietta
Maria, the <i>Fables</i> of La Fontaine with the arms of
Marie Antoinette as Dauphine, an unquestioned Grolier
or Maioli, and still more such a bibliographical ph&oelig;nix
as that volume bound in gold of Lady Elizabeth
Tyrrwhit's <i>Prayers</i>, formerly belonging to Queen Elizabeth,
which the late Sir Wollaston Franks purchased
at an incredible price and presented to the British
Museum&mdash;these, and many more, speak for themselves.
Yet where a royal or noble personage is not in the case,
when it is only some Shakespeare or some Milton who
is concerned, let us preferably have the written internal
passport. We would barter all the books which we have
indicated for the Florio's <i>Montaigne</i> with the poet's
signature on the fly-leaf, albeit it is in no better a
covering than its Shakespearian jacket of shabby old
calf.</p>

<p>More than one volume in the earlier range depends
very disproportionately for its interest on the preliminary
matter in the form of a Preface or Dedication. In
<i>Prefaces, Dedications, Epistles</i>, 1874, the writer drew
attention to this point, and furnished a considerable
series of such <i>prolegomena</i> in illustration of the fact.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[<a href="./images/215.png">215</a>]</span>
But there are cases, of course, where the inscription is
of a piece with the book, as in Davenant's <i>Madagascar</i>,
1638, where the poet wrote and printed on the leaf
following the title: "If these Poems live, may their
Memories, by whom they were cherish'd, <i>End. Porter,
H. Jarmyn</i>, live with them."</p>

<p>The Imprimatur, or License to the Printer, occasionally
supplies a curious literary or biographical side-light.
That to Davenant's play of the <i>Witts</i>, 1636, runs: "This
Play, called the <span class="smcap">Witts</span>, as it was Acted without offence,
may be Printed, not otherwise, 19 Ianuary, 1635. Henry
Herbert;" and before Blount's <i>Jocular Tenures</i>, 1679, we
find: "I well knowing the Learning and industry of the
Author, do allow the Printing of this Book. Fra. North."
Once more there is Sir Isaac Newton's <i>Principia</i>, 1687,
with "Imprimatur. S. Pepys."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may be necessary to introduce a few words about the
material on which the Printed Book has at various times
been brought before its readers, or at least its purchasers.
The oldest European fabrics employed for books of this
class (not MSS.) were paper and parchment, the latter
very often prepared with very slight care, but the former
of remarkable strength and durability. The cost must
have been at first very onerous; but impressions of
ancient volumes were usually limited. By degrees, fine
vellum, alike conspicuous for its delicacy of quality and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[<a href="./images/217.png">217</a>]</span>
beauty of tone, was introduced, and became fashionable
among the patrons of literature in Italy and elsewhere
during the Renaissance. No such luxurious mode of
presenting the type and giving full effect to the work of
the illuminator, which so constantly formed a feature
and a charm in the productions of the presses of the
Continent of Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
has ever since been found possible. It is rather
singular that not merely classical authors and other
<i>editiones principes</i> received this sumptuous treatment,
but even such books as grammars and theological treatises.
A copy of the <i>Grammatica</i> of Alexander Gallus (or <i>De
Vill&acirc; Dei</i>) was lately offered for sale by auction, and
realised &pound;23; it was printed on vellum of excellent character
and colour about 1480.</p>

<p>A visit to the galleries where the show-cases are
ranged at the British Museum in intelligible order, is
by no means the worst method of arriving at an introductory
or general acquaintance with this aspect of the
matter. For there examples of printing on parchment
or vellum in all countries from the earliest period are
conveniently grouped together. The National Library is
fairly rich in treasures of the present class, partly owing
to the two facts, that it has inherited a good deal from
the old royal collections and the Grenville one, and that
it was already in the field when prices were more consistent
with the financial resources of the institution.
Among the productions on vellum here to be found are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[<a href="./images/218.png">218</a>]</span>
the Gutenberg, and Fust and Schoeffer, Bibles (1455-62);
the Psalters of 1457 and 1459; the Cicero of 1465; the
Livy of 1469; the <i>Book of St. Albans</i>, 1486; one of the
two known Caxtons on vellum (the <i>Speculum Vit&aelig; Christi</i>,
bought of Mr. Maskell in 1864); the Sarum Missals of
1492 and 1497; the Great Bible of 1540; and the Works
of Aquinas, in seventeen folio volumes, formerly belonging
to Pope Pius V. and Philip III. of Spain. A curious
episode is connected with the last item. In the time
of Panizzi the copy was offered for sale, and the Museum
commission (&pound;300, we believe) was topped; but the book
occurred again, and was acquired by Coventry Patmore,
who presented it to the establishment, where he had for
many years been an officer.</p>

<p>On the whole, there is no doubt that the English, and
much more the Scotish, printers employed this costly and
durable substance far more sparingly than those of the
Continent. Of many no specimens whatever have descended
to us; and the circumstances render it improbable
that we shall hereafter add sensibly to our stores in this
direction. In the case even of the Romish service-books,
printed on paper, it is a matter of common knowledge
among book-lovers that the <i>Canon Miss&aelig;</i>, which was
subject to exceptional wear and tear, is usually on vellum.</p>

<p>In our own language, works which we are accustomed
to view as essentially popular were occasionally struck off
(in a few copies, no doubt) on parchment. There is the
edition of <i>Helyas, Knight of the Swan</i>, printed by Wynkyn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[<a href="./images/219.png">219</a>]</span>
de Worde, 1512, of which only one copy remains, and the
metrical version of the <i>Ship of Fools</i>, from the same press,
1509, of which an unique copy is in the National French
library. Let us recollect, too, the Scotish Boece of 1536,
the Great Bible of 1539, and the Tudor Prayer-Book of
1544.</p>

<p>Except paper, parchment (called in some old documents
<i>parthemen</i>), and vellum, there are no substances
which can be said to boast any degree of antiquity, so
far as European literature is concerned. We have, as is
sufficiently well known, many others of comparatively
modern introduction, which tend to impart to the editions
or specimens for which they are employed a special value
and curiosity. Such are: (1) Whatman's hand-made
paper; (2) Dutch paper (<i>papier de Hollande</i>), of which
there are cheap and worthless imitations; (3) China
paper; (4) India paper; (5) Japanese (so-called) vellum;
(6) tinted paper; (7) writing paper; (8) motley paper or
paper of different colours; (9) silk; (10) satin.</p>

<p>The <i>edition de luxe</i> has consumed in its time an
enormous total of some of these descriptions of receptacle
for literary products. The lovers of the Select in
Books, who more commonly regard their possessions as
<i>vertu</i> rather than as vehicles of instruction or amusement,
not unnaturally prefer something which the
ordinary purchaser cannot procure, or at any rate does
not seek. The fancy appears to be, for the most part,
worse than futile, unless it is that books with engravings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<a href="./images/220.png">220</a>]</span>
sometimes gain by being taken off on one or another of
these materials; although in practice illustrations are
found to be just as apt to come out well on ordinary
paper of good quality as on spurious vellum. It was
not unusual in the last century, in Mexico and in South
America, to print on silk even ordinary works; it may
have been possibly found cheaper than paper. Satin is
purely ceremonial.</p>

<p>Certain books occur of various dates, such as the
<i>Livre de Quatre Couleurs</i>, printed on paper of various
shades or colours, either for some passing reason or as
a mere matter of fancy. A modern jest-book appeared
not long since, harmoniously executed on motley paper
in a motley binding&mdash;a humorous conceit!</p>

<p>It is sufficiently remarkable that neither the Printing
nor the Book-binding industries ever erected themselves
into societies or guilds, as did the representatives of so
many trades far less important in the nature as well as
the influence of their products. All the early typographers,
at all events from the sixteenth century, were
members of the Stationers' Company, and the investiture
of books in liveries of different kinds became the function
of an unprivileged and unchartered body, of which our
knowledge is on that account even more limited and
imperfect than it would otherwise have been. It is
only through occasional and casual notices in correspondence
or diaries that we hear of those who bound
volumes for the older collectors, and we have to wait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[<a href="./images/221.png">221</a>]</span>
till we come down to the Harleian era, before we find
artificers of this class in possession of a recognised calling
and competent staff. Three employments, which have
long been independent and distinct, those of the printer,
stationer, and binder, were therefore at first and during
a prolonged period in the same hands and under the
same roof.</p>

<p>Anterior to the introduction of printed books, the
literary product or record was either rolled up (<i>volutus</i>) or
stitched, with or without a wrapper; and hence, when there
were no volumes in the more modern acceptation in existence,
there were rolls. We do not agree with the editor
of Aubrey's <i>Letters</i>, &amp;c., 1813, where, in a note to a letter
from Thomas Baker to Hearne, he (the editor) remarks
that the term <i>explicitus</i> was applied to the completion of
the process of unfolding a roll: it always signified the
termination of the labour of the scribe, and even in early
printed books occurs in the form <i>explicit</i> to convey the
same idea on the part of the printer.</p>

<p>The most ancient binders were the monks, who stitched
together their own compositions or transcripts, or, when
the volume was more substantial, encased it in oaken
boards, which a subsequent hand often improved and
preserved by a coat of leather. But laymen were occasionally
their own binders, as we perceive in the note to
Warton's Poetry,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> where a "Life of Concubranus" in MS.
is said to have been bound by William Edis, afterward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>
a monk at Burton-on-Trent, while he was a student at
Oxford in 1517.</p>

<p>At Durham and Winchester there were notable
schools of art of the present class in the Middle Ages,
and specimens occasionally occur, though rarely in good
state. A very fine Winchester piece of work was sold
in 1898 among William Morris's books (No. 580), and
all over the country and abroad, even down to the present
time, the inmates of religious institutions occupy
themselves with the same industry on a less ambitious scale,
and with infinitely less artistic and picturesque results.</p>

<p>When Barclay wrote his English paraphrase of
Brandt's <i>Stulltifera Navis</i> about 1508, it almost seems
as if the type of connoisseur, who understood the outside
better than the interior of a book, was already in
evidence, for the writer says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Still am I busy bookes assembling,</p>
<p class="ihalf">For to have plentie it is a pleasaunt thing</p>
<p class="ihalf">In my concept, and to haue them ay in hand:</p>
<p class="ihalf">But what they meane do I not vnderstand. . . .</p>
<p class="ihalf">Lo in likewise of bookes I haue store,</p>
<p class="ihalf">But fewe I reade, and fewer vnderstande,</p>
<p class="ihalf">I folowe not their doctrine nor their lore,</p>
<p class="ihalf">It is ynough to beare a booke in hande."</p>
</div></div>

<p>In Barclay's English <i>Ship of Fools</i>, 1509, it is stated
that at that time damask, satin, and velvet were employed
as luxurious materials for the covering of books,
and it seems to have been usual to draw a curtain before
the case in which they were preserved. Showy or gay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>
bindings were approved, especially where the owner was
not a reader, but, to quote the Latin text, was "Viridi
contentus tegmine libri."</p>

<p>The formation of Book-binding into a distinct employment
and organisation must have preceded any
explicit evidence of the fact. The gradual increase in
the output of literature of all kinds from the days of
Elizabeth necessitated the surrender to an independent
craft of the envelopment of volumes in various liveries,
more especially when the French and Italians had set
the fashion of elaborate ornamental patterns and rich
gilding. Already in the time of Edward VI. the tariff
chargeable for certain quasi-official publications, such as the
Bible and Book of Common Prayer, was fixed by Government,
and at a later date scales of prices for binding in
different styles or materials were periodically printed. That
of 1646 is reprinted entire in the <i>Antiquary</i> for 1886.</p>

<p>The most usual styles were plain brown sheep or calf
without any lettering, a publisher's label inside the volume
sometimes supplying the latter deficiency, and communicating
to a shelf of books an aspect far from picturesque;
but vellum or parchment of varying consistence was also
a favourite and inexpensive mode of covering the contents
of a library. Morocco and russia were later innovations,
and the former is not unusually found altogether free
from decoration or gilding and with a lettering, probably
abbreviated and obscure, on the back. Very sumptuous
examples alike of calf and turkey leather binding fre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[<a href="./images/224.png">224</a>]</span>quently
present themselves, either executed for ordinary
persons, or without any note of the original owner;
many are more or less successful copies of Continental
models, such as the Lyonnese calf, the Grolier and Maioli
pattern; but in general our ancestors seem to have been
satisfied with the paned sides and floriate back, unless
heraldic accessories intervened to usurp the space occupied
by the lateral ornament or (as in some of John Evelyn's
or his sovereign's books) a gilt ornamental cypher formed
the dorsal embellishment.</p>

<p>A visit to some old church or parish, or even cathedral,
library nowadays may afford a notion of the external
aspect of the early book-closet of the English student
or amateur. The glass case is conspicuously absent; the
shelf on which the volumes are ranged has to our eyes
a ragged, slatternly look; and nothing can well be more
opposite to modern taste. Yet the feeling for the printed
matter between the two covers or behind the paper label
was more genuine, may be, and more practical when a
handful of volumes, reflecting the personal predilections
or requirements of the owner, gradually accumulated,
and the acquisition did not amount to a pursuit, much
less to a passion and a competitive race.</p>

<p>The professional binding of books in our country,
whether they had been actually produced here or had
been purchased abroad, was at the outset almost exclusively
executed by printers, who must have had a
special department to carry out this branch of work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<a href="./images/225.png">225</a>]</span>
We hear of the site of Dean Colet's original school
having been a bookbinder's, and of the teaching establishment
occupying the upper part of the building. The
usual style of binding appears to have been the covering
of stamped leather, of which such a rich store of examples
still survives, and which was copied from the German
and Low-Country models. For weightier books oaken
boards frequently served as a foundation, on which the
leather was laid. Our sovereigns and nobility employed
Pynson, Berthelet, Raynes, and other typographers to
clothe the volumes which formed their libraries, before
the more luxurious and splendid fashion was introduced
of investing them in richly gilt calf bindings, with or
without armorial cognisances, and these were again superseded
by the adoption of the Continental taste for Levant
morocco (<i>maroquin de Constantinople</i>).</p>

<p>Down to the time of the earlier Stuarts the binding
department more than probably remained part of the
printer's functions, and calf or sheep was the usual
material employed. Thomas Vautrollier, however, the
Elizabethan typographer, who carried on business in the
Black Friars, and who adopted the <i>Anchora Spei</i> as a
device on his title-pages, seems to have occasionally
bound copies of his own publications in morocco with
the same symbol on the covers in gold&mdash;perhaps to order;
and Lyonnese calf was another style in favour at the
same date. Some highly preserved specimens of the latter
have descended to us.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[<a href="./images/226.png">226</a>]</span>
Another of the earlier essays in England in the
direction of morocco bindings appears to have had in
view as a model the Grolieresque style of decoration.
A copy of a Latin Bible printed at Venice in 1537,
and presented in 1563 by the Earl of Arundel to Sir
William Petre, bears the crest of the Fitzalans, a white
horse, on sides enclosed in a painted design, the compartments
filled in with a dotted pattern. But examples of
the same or a similar class are by no means uncommon.
A copy of a very common volume, Knolles's <i>History of the
Turks</i>, 1638, was sold among the Morris books in 1898
at a high price on account of the very charming red
morocco binding, richly gilt, with the unusual feature of
side-panels filled in with dotted scrolls.</p>

<p>Early Continental collectors more usually than our
own registered not only the place and date of purchase
on the fly-leaf or title-page, but the circumstances attendant
on the binding, as we find in the volume of tracts
elsewhere mentioned, put into their existing covers in
1469, in the nearly coeval assemblage of tracts formed
and bound by Udalric Ellenbog in 1476, and in the
Latin <i>Petrarch</i> of 1501, bound for Antonius Kressen of
N&uuml;rnberg in 1505, now in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The middle-period schools of collectors and binders,
who displayed a preference for morocco over russia and
calf, were assuredly wise in their generation. Much of
the russia has perished, or is perishing fast, under a
variety of deleterious agencies; and the more modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[<a href="./images/227.png">227</a>]</span>
calf, at least, does not bear its years well. But morocco,
at first more expensive, withstands infinitely better and
longer the incidence of social life. What noble sets of
books, as well as single volumes, have almost crumbled
away in damp country-houses, sometimes relegated to
the garret or the stable by the intelligent and highly-educated
proprietors, while others have fallen a prey to
gas and dust in town. These sources of injury and
natural ruin no material can of course long resist; and,
the foreigner often enjoying the advantage of a less
impure atmosphere, and not usually aiming at a larger
collection than may be necessary as chamber-furniture,
his acquisitions are apt to come down to us in a more
contemporary state, although we grant that, where certain
postulates have been fulfilled, we have shown our capability
of presenting to a distant age an assemblage of the
ancient literature of our own and other countries as
immaculate as when it changed hands over the counter in
Tudor or in Stuart times.</p>

<p>Binding and Bibliography, no less than literature, are
in opposite lobbies as regards the character of the objects
which one sees submitted to periodical competition. The
taste in books has undergone revolutionary changes; the
volumes on which early owners lavished extravagant
sums have too often become <i>per se</i> waste paper; and it
consequently happens that a catalogue devoted to an
account of such relics of the past has to register titles
and names which play a subordinate part in the matter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[<a href="./images/228.png">228</a>]</span>
and are, as it were, merely useful as a means of identification.</p>

<p>While a large number of splendid examples of binding
in russia and morocco have been produced in Great
Britain, there has scarcely been at any time a school of
binding analogous to those which France, and even Italy,
have known, each with its distinctive and recognisable
characteristics; nor have we attained in the liveries of
our books to the same splendour and beauty of decoration,
or to an equal degree of historical or personal interest.</p>

<p>A large number of fine examples present themselves
in our sale-rooms here, formerly ornaments of some of
the noble collections formed in different parts of Germany;
too often they show traces of neglect, yet occasionally
they have preserved their pristine beauty and freshness
almost unimpaired. They are, for the most part, of the
very favourite class, where the oaken boards constitute
a receptacle or foundation for an encasement of leather
(frequently pigskin) stamped with some beautiful historiette
on either side, and carrying the date and other
particulars of origin and ownership. We meet with
numerous specimens from time to time of the libraries
of the Electors of Saxony and Bavaria in this picturesque
and becoming raiment.</p>

<p>There should be by right, and with advantage, as
distinct an intellectual spirit or element of thought in
the binding as in the writing and printing of a book.
A man who traces on the covers and back of a volume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[<a href="./images/229.png">229</a>]</span>
lines, curves, circles, crescents, scrolls, and other figures
without harmony and without significance&mdash;in other
words, without <i>mind</i> or <i>esprit</i>&mdash;is no true artist, but
either an unskilful copyist or a rude beginner. Different
schools naturally adopted new ideas of the beautiful or
the elegant; some of our most ancient patterns were
scriptural or mathematical; the age ruled the prevailing
taste and fashion, and everything in and out of Nature
has had its turn and its day. Then, again, nationality
goes for something: the Frenchman is fond of his <i>lis</i>
and the Scot of his thistle.</p>

<p>Artistic and historical book-covers have more than
a special and technical importance, inasmuch as they
contribute to enrich a pursuit which might otherwise
become more limited in its interest than it is. For gay
or splendid bindings assist in bringing the Book, manuscript
or printed, within the category of antiquities or
curiosities, where it awakens sentiments in the breasts
of persons, neither literary nor bibliographical in their
tastes, akin to those which they entertain for a specimen
of old furniture or old porcelain; and so indeed we see
entire libraries, which are little more than assemblages
of triumphs of the binder's art and agreeable memorials
of prior ownership. A once rather famous emporium in
Piccadilly was known as the Temple of Leather and
Literature, because the extrinsic was supposed to govern;
and the same point is illustrated by the enormous
difference in pecuniary value between copies of many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>
old works in morocco and in more humble garb. Here
Dress makes the book no less than in the song it is said
to make the man. So it was with the three independent
libraries of <i>Mesdames de France</i>, daughters of Louis XV.
Each of these ladies had her favourite hue in morocco,
with the royal arms on the sides; for Madame Adelaide
it was red, for Madame Sophie, citron, and for Madame
Victoire, green or olive. The ornamental details of early
bindings, especially those of Continental origin, embrace
nearly every section of natural history: beasts, birds,
fishes, insects, flowers, and fruit, and endless varieties of
geometrical lines and curves. A Spanish New Testament,
printed at Venice in 1556, even presented on its sides
what were described in the Ashburnham Catalogue as
"richly gilt raindrops." Among flowers we most frequently
meet with the rose, the daisy, the lily, and the tulip.</p>

<p>Many varieties of form in connection with the gift of
books to friends or patrons formerly subsisted, apart from
the autograph note inside the volume. We have adverted
to the Grolier group of bindings and certain other allied
types perhaps borrowed from Grolier, and the practice
was followed, though on a very limited scale, in England,
where the token in all cases was mainly confined to the
title or fly-leaf, and consequently enters into a distinct
category. A very unusual example of presentation occurs
in a copy printed on vellum of Voerthusius' <i>Consecrationis
August&aelig; Liber Unus</i>, printed at Antwerp in 1563, where
the centres of either side of the volume are occupied by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[<a href="./images/231.png">231</a>]</span>
an inscription in gold letters to the Archbishop-Elector
of Cologne.</p>

<p>Of the Grolier examples which have descended to us&mdash;and
possibly the greater part has done so&mdash;we possess
two or three types as regards the mode of registering
the proprietorship; the books occur with and without the
autograph: "Jo. Grolierij Lugdunensis: et Amicorum,"
which generally occurs at the end, and with variant
mottoes: "Portio mea Domine sit in Terra Viventium,"
"Spes mea Dominus et verbo ejus fidem habeo," and
"&AElig;que difficilior." He was a noble patron of learning,
and on the title of a volume on Music, printed in
1518, dedicated to him, appear his arms and the motto,
"Joannes Grolierius Musarum Cultor."</p>

<p>To the same school belongs the equally well-known
Maioli, with the similar method of establishing his claim:
"Tho. Maioli et Amicorum;" Cristoforo Beneo of Milan
("Questo libro e de Christophore Beneo de Milano e
soi Amize"); Antonio Maldonado, of whom a volume
of Petrarch has on the upper cover the name of the poet,
and on the reverse, "D. Antonio Maldonado," with a
shield enclosing five fleurs-de-lis; and Penelope Coleona,
with flowering vases heightened in silver, and her initials
at the foot of the book.</p>

<p>This is, of course, a most fascinating and covetable
class of possession, and the difficulty of procuring genuine
specimens of the Henry Deux and Diane de Poitiers
bindings, and of all the other sumptuous and artistic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>
productions of a like character belonging to the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, has naturally suggested to certain
ingenious persons the desirability of counterfeiting them.
The Maioli bindings have long been subject to this
treatment and abuse; but at present almost every other
book which offers itself in a fine state of preservation is
suspicious from a wholesale system of forgery, which has
more or less recently been introduced with considerable
success, and culminated in an entire sale at a leading
auction-room of a library almost exclusively composed
of such fabrications.</p>

<p>Of the genuine old English bindings, the usual
materials are vellum or parchment and sheep or calf.
All these may be, and in general are, ostentatiously
plain; but they are, on the contrary, susceptible of being
rendered in the highest degree ornamental. Nothing is
more agreeable to the eye, and even the touch, than an
old book in contemporary gilt calf, with arms on the
sides, or in the original vellum wrapper, or, again, in the
plebeian <i>mutton</i>.</p>

<p>The two former modes of treatment may, as we have
said, be developed to any extent in the direction of
tooling and gilding; the sheep has to be left unadorned&mdash;<i>simplex
munditiis</i>.</p>

<p>What can we desire more characteristic and harmonious
than a Caxton, uncut and in oaken boards, or even in a
secondary vesture of vellum, like the Holford copy of
the <i>Life of Godfrey of Bouillon</i>? Or than a volume of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
Elizabethan poetry or a first Walton's <i>Angler</i>, in the
primitive sheep, as clean as a new penny, like the Huth
examples of Turbervile, 1570, and Walton? The purest
copy of the first folio Shakespeare we ever saw was Miss
Napier's, in the original calf, but wanting the verses.
It sold at the sale for &pound;151, and subsequently for over
&pound;400. There exist such things as Laneham's <i>Letter from
Kenilworth</i>, 1575, Spenser's <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, 1590, Allot's
<i>England's Parnassus</i>, 1600, and Davison's <i>Poetical
Rhapsody</i>, 1611, in the pristine vellum wrappers; and
one of the Bodleian copies of Brathwaite's most rare <i>Good
Wife</i>, 1618, is just as it was received 280 years since from
the stationer who issued it. Would any one wish to see
these remains tricked out in the sprucest, or even the
richest, modern habiliments?</p>

<p>Among ourselves in these islands we commonly prize
and preserve (even in a leathern case) a highly preserved
specimen of Tudor or Stuart binding; and there are
instances where to exchange the old coat for a new one,
however magnificent or (so to speak) appropriate, is not
merely sacrilege, but absolute surrender of value. A
copy of the first folio Shakespeare, of a Caxton, of
Spenser's <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, in unblemished primitive clothing,
could not be re-attired without making the party convicted
of the act liable to capital punishment without
benefit of clergy.</p>

<p>Besides the methods and kinds of binding above
mentioned, there are others of a metallic and a textile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[<a href="./images/234.png">234</a>]</span>
character. We find volumes clothed in bronze, silver,
silver-gilt, gold, and embroidered silks, the last variety
usually associated with the Nunnery of Little Gidding,
without absolute certainty of correctness so far as the
claim set up on behalf of that institution to be an
exclusive source of such products goes. Mr. Brassington
has furnished in his well-known work examples of all
these more or less exceptional and luxurious liveries.
In the most precious metal the most celebrated specimen
is the <i>Book of Prayers</i> of Lady Elizabeth Tirrwhyt,
1574, formerly belonging to Queen Elizabeth, and ascribed
to the Edinburgh goldsmith, George Heriot.
Next in point of rarity to gold comes bronze; silver and
silver-gilt are comparatively frequent; and the embroidered
style is only uncommon where the execution
and condition are unimpeachable, as in the case of a
few in our public libraries. The most ordinary books
found within embroidered covers are small editions of
the Common Prayer and Psalms; and they are almost
invariably in a dilapidated state. Gilding books was
usually considered at a later epoch, at all events in
France, part of the business of a binder, and so perhaps
it may have been in the case of Dubuisson, who flourished
about the middle of the last century at Paris; yet we
observe on his ticket attached to an exquisitely gilt copy
of an almanac for 1747, in red morocco of the period,
simply "<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Dor&egrave;'">Dor&eacute;</ins> par Dubuisson," as if that portion or
branch of the work only had been his.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[<a href="./images/235.png">235</a>]</span>
Some curious episodes have ere now occurred in
connection with sets of books, or even works in two or
three volumes, in historical bindings, or with a remarkable
and interesting <i>provenance</i> of another kind. It was only
at the sale of the last portion of the Ashburnham
Library (1898), No. 3574, that the third and fourth
parts of Tasso, <i>Rime e Prose</i>, 1589, bound together by
Clovis Eve for Marie-Marguerite de Valois Saint-Remy,
was acquired by a French firm through Mr. Quaritch, the
purchaser having already secured at the Hamilton Palace
sale the first and second portions, also in one volume, in
the same binding, and the set still wants Parts v.-vi., so
that it will demand a small fortune to effect a perfect
reunion.</p>

<p>It is hazardous to discount the durability and permanence
of our best modern bindings of English origin,
and to answer our own question, whether hereafter they
will be appreciated in the same way as those of the old
masters here and abroad. Yet we think that we can
offer a valid and persuasive reason why we shall fall
short of former ages in this handicraft. The feudal
conditions and atmosphere, which go far to win our
regard or arrest our attention in the case of the older
binders and their work, have vanished, and can never
revive. It is with the book from this point of view as
it is from that of the autograph inscription or signature;
both are extensions of the owner's personality; and what
a personality it was! Those who follow us at a distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>
may find reason to think and speak differently; but we
can at the present moment scarcely realise the possibility
of our latter-day literature acquiring a pedigree and an
incrusted fragrance such as belong to works, however
dull and worthless in themselves, from the libraries of
Grolier, Maioli, De Thou, Peiresc, or Pompadour. There
is a sort of sensation of awe in taking up these volumes,
as if they had passed through some holy ordeal, as if they
had been canonised. It is not the piece of dressed leather
with its decorative adjuncts which casts its spell over us:
it is the reputation of the courtly patron of learning and
art; of the statesman and soldier who sought a diversion
in the formation of a library from severer employments; of
the prince who loved to gather round him such evidences
of his taste, or to lay them at the feet of <i>a ch&egrave;re amie</i>; of
the licentious but superb Lady Marquise, who vied with
her king in the magnificence of her books, as she did with
his consort in that of her toilette&mdash;it is this which exercises
upon our imagination its ridiculous yet unalterable sway.</p>

<p>It is impossible to avoid the discovery, if we take for
the first time a survey of a library chiefly conspicuous for
the splendour of its bindings, how almost invariably we
are disappointed by the contrast between the exterior and
the contents. It would probably be far from easy to fill a
small case with examples where a really valuable book
was enshrined in a covering of corresponding character.
It is our ordinary experience to meet with some obsolete
nondescript classic, or some defunct theological treatise of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<a href="./images/237.png">237</a>]</span>
alike infinitesimal worth, in a sumptuous morocco garb,
bestowed on it by the author as a compliment to his
sovereign, or by the sovereign as an oblation to his mistress.
In those princely establishments for which such things were
destined and reserved, it was necessary that all the constituent
features should correspond in external grandeur,
the costumes of the great folks themselves, the furniture,
the decorations, the equipages, the dependents, the book-bindings.</p>

<p>The remarkable changes of taste in books cannot be
more powerfully and decisively exemplified than by the
thousands of volumes which have descended to us in all
languages and many branches of literature in liveries once
only a subsidiary feature in the eyes of the possessors or
acquirers, and at present often the sole title to regard and
the sole object of competition. The work has become
mere printed paper; but it is perhaps not less covetable
as a triumph of bibliopegistic art, than as a memorial of
the distinguished or interesting personages through whose
hands it has passed to our own. The book, alas! has
degenerated into a vehicle for external accessories. We
are asked to admire, not the quality of the text or the
style of the writer, but the beauty of the type, the
splendour of the ink, and the elegance of the initial letters,
on the one hand; on the other, the excellence of the
leather, the brilliance of the gilding, the ingenuity and
skill of the design, and the curiosity of the <i>ex libris</i>.
But this has to be kept well in mind. It is the binding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<a href="./images/238.png">238</a>]</span>
which constitutes the supreme feature of importance and
attraction. A second copy in shabby attire may plead in
vain its merits of production; but it fares as ill as a person
of the highest respectability who labours under the misfortune
of being badly dressed.</p>

<p>There is no point of distinction on the part of our own
countrymen more marked and enduring than the very
qualified allegiance which they give to the Parisian book-binding
code. It is true enough that in England we
admire not merely the old French School, but the modern
one; but our loyalty and liking are by no means
unreserved. A Frenchman, in nine cases out of ten, will
not, in the first place, buy any book that was born out of
France, any more than he will buy an article of furniture
or china, or a coin, emanating from a less favoured soil;
nor will he willingly acquire even a volume of native
origin in any state but the orthodox morocco; but his first
impulse and act, if he does so under protest, is to strip and
re-clothe the disreputable article, and have it put into
habiliments worthy of the <i>cabinet choisi</i> of Monsieur.</p>

<p>Now, we have had, and no doubt have still, on this
side of the Channel certain heathens in the likeness of
collectors who, no matter how perfect and how fresh, and
how suitable, the original jacket, commit the heinous
offence of following the Continental mode, and in such a
way thousands of lovely examples, transmitted to us as
heirlooms from our ancient families, have been sacrificed.
But let us congratulate ourselves that we have among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[<a href="./images/239.png">239</a>]</span>
us many who know better, who will not even let the
binder desecrate a faultless copy of Tennyson, Byron,
Shelley, or Keats in the publisher's boards.</p>

<p>This is, however, not exactly an analogy. The analogy
arises and grows possible when we compare such writers
as Montaigne, Moli&egrave;re, Corneille, or again, certain of
the Elzevir series, with our corresponding foremost names.
If we meet with the latter in vellum or in sheep, we only
too gladly preserve them as we find them, provided that
the outward garb is irreproachable. Of how many gems
do we not know, in all the peerless glory of their pristine
life, tenderly ensconced in morocco envelopes. Let them
never be acquainted with another existence! Let no
binder's unholy hand come near them! Let them be
exhibited as historical monuments.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we could oblige Monsieur to
comply with this law, he would be <i><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'desol&egrave;'">d&eacute;sol&eacute;</ins></i>; for it is not the
matter which makes the book; it is the <i>maroquin rouge</i>.</p>

<p>Even in England, where we are more robust in our
taste, the true collector is not a reader. He may buy a
cheap book now and then; but he hands it to the cook
when he has perused it. Such things are outside his
category; they are for those interesting creatures the
toiling million. His possessions or <i>desiderata</i> are not
vehicles of instruction; they are far too valuable; they are
objects of ocular and sensuous indulgence equally with
china, paintings, sculpture, and coins. They are classable
with bric-&agrave;-brac. You have an opportunity of appreciating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[<a href="./images/240.png">240</a>]</span>
the quality of the paper or vellum, the type, and the
binding. The merits of the author are reserved.</p>

<p>It is better, if a gentleman leans a little to the practical
side, and chooses to admit literature for actual reading, to
have two cases, one for Books, the other for Bibliographical
<i>Simulacra</i>. For it is not for one till he has graduated to
lay his prentice fingers on a tome in the pristine <i>mutton</i>, or
to endanger the maidenhood of a Clovis Eve, a Padeloup,
or a Derome, which you must handle as if it were the
choicest and daintiest proof medal or etching. Why, one
has to bear in mind that he is not dealing with a mere ordinary
source of intellectual gratification and improvement,
but with a mechanical product perfect in all its parts. Let
him come gloved, and his friend the owner will bless him.</p>

<p>Between a book bound in its original cloth or paper
boards, and one in its rich vesture of morocco or russia,
there is a contrast similar to that between a woodland
and a park. In the one case, at a distance, perhaps, of
fifty or even a hundred years from the period of publication,
we hold in our hand a volume precisely in the state
in which it passed from that of the contemporary salesman
to the contemporary buyer; and not a stain nor a finger-mark
save the mellowing touch of time is upon it anywhere.
Let us look at the description in a sale catalogue of such a
rarity as Lamb's <i>Poetry for Children</i>, 1807, "in the original
grey boards, with red labels," or a copy of the first edition
of Fielding's <i>Tom Jones</i>, absolutely uncut, and in the bookseller's
pristine covers, or, better still, of the first part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span>
the first edition of Spenser's <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, 1590, in the
Elizabethan wrapper! It is not the mere circumstance, let
it be understood, of untrimmed edges which makes the
charm; many a book or pamphlet occurs as innocent of
the binder's knife as the lamb unborn, and highly desirable
it is too; but to render an example of this class complete,
its authentic outward integument in blameless preservation
is as essential to its repute and its marketable worth
as the presence of the claws is held to be in the original
valuation of a fur of fox or beaver.</p>

<p>No educated eye can regard with indifference a more
or less interesting volume clothed in a becoming livery by
an accomplished artist either of other times or of these. If
it is an ancient vesture, with the credentials in the form of
a coat of arms, an <i>ex libris</i>, or a signature, or all of these,
handed down with it to us, we appear to be able to disregard
time, and feel ourselves brought within touch of the
individual who owned it, of him who encased it in its
lavishly gilt leathern coat, and of the circle to which it
was long a familiar object, as it reposed unmolested in a
corner of some <i>petite biblioth&egrave;que</i> or study during generations&mdash;if
the subject of which it treated had to be handled,
a vicarious copy in working raiment doing duty for it.
For it is not a book in the ordinary acceptation of the word;
it is a <i>souvenir</i> of the past, a message and a voice from remote
times, ever growing remoter, or an <i>objet de luxe</i>, a
piece of literary, or rather bibliographical, dandyism. In
any case, its identity is to be preserved and held sacred.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> English School of Binding brings before us a roll
of names borne by artists of successive periods and of
varying merit, from the last quarter of the fifteenth
century to the present time. That it is by no means
exhaustive is due to the circumstance that in the case of
many of the older, and some of the more recent, masters,
there is no clue to the origin in the shape of an external
inscription on the cover, as we find on foreign works, or
in that of a ticket or a signature. As it so frequently
happens with old pictures, the style of a binder was
often, indeed generally, imitated by his pupils or suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>cessors,
and we are apt to mistake the original productions
for the copies, unless we engage in a very close
study of minute details.</p>

<p>In the English, Scotish, and Irish series it is equally
true that the preponderance of bindings are unidentified.
The monastic liveries, in which so many venerable tomes
have come down to us, were executed within the walls of
the buildings which held the books, and had perhaps
produced them; and analogously most of our early
printers were binders of their own stocks, as well as of
any other works brought to them. We may incidentally
remind the reader that one practice on their part was to
utilise waste as end-papers or pasteboard, and to that circumstance
we are indebted for the recovery of numerous
typographical fragments belonging to publications not
otherwise known. That Pynson, Julian Notary, John
Reynes, and others executed book-binding outside their
own productions seems to be proved by the existence of
much early literature of foreign origin with English end-papers
and covers. In fact, till the Stationers' Company
made the sale of books or printed matter a separate
industry, the typographer was his own binder and vendor.</p>

<p>The bibliopegist, as an independent artificer whom we
are able to identify, dates from the seventeenth century.
We have already mentioned Francis Rea or Read of
Worcester as flourishing in 1660. John Evelyn seems to
have employed some one who executed good work in
morocco, and in better taste than that done for royalty at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[<a href="./images/244.png">244</a>]</span>
the same period; yet we cannot be sure that he did not
carry the books abroad for the purpose. Pepys had in
his service a binder named Richardson, whom he mentions
in the <i>Diary</i>, and who is otherwise known. A copy of
Stow's <i>Survey</i>, 1633, passed through his hands; it is in
the original calf; and he was merely engaged to repair it,
as appears from a memorandum inside the cover.</p>

<p>Of authentic names of later English binders, considering
the incalculable amount of work done, the number is
extremely limited. If we tabulate, we find only:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[<a href="./images/245.png">245</a>]</span>This represents not only the entire assemblage and
succession, so far as England is concerned, but covers
Scotland and Ireland; and several of the names are obviously
those of foreigners. The Scotish artists, if, as there
is no absolute reason to doubt, a large number of early
books were clothed on the spot, possessed much taste and
originality, and some of them have descended to us in a
pristine state of preservation with the lavish gilding as
fresh and brilliant as when they left the workshop. We may
fairly consider, looking at the intimate relationship between
Scotland and France in former times, that a certain
proportion of volumes of Scotish origin were bound
abroad, just as Americans at present send over their books
to England. Coming down to more recent days, the
two names chiefly associated with Scotland are C. Murton
and J. Mackenzie, neither of whom attained special
celebrity.</p>

<p>But it is to be more than suspected that all important
work in this direction was long executed out of Scotland&mdash;either
in London or in Paris. The time came, however,
when the Scots acquired a school and style of their own,
and all that can be pleaded for it is, that it is manneristic
and peculiar. Of recent years heavy prices have been
paid for first-class examples, which are of unusual rarity.
Messrs. Kerr &amp; Richardson, of Glasgow, bought over
Mr. Quaritch at the Laing sale in London at a preposterous
figure (&pound;295) a copy of one of Sir George
Mackenzie's legal works simply for the covers; it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>
offered by the purchasers afterward to the underbidder,
who quietly informed them that he had come to his
senses again.</p>

<p>There is no reason why the magnificent copy on
vellum of Boece's <i>Chronicles of Scotland</i> (1536), which
occurred at the Hamilton sale in 1884, should not have
received its clothing of oaken boards covered with gilt
calf at home.</p>

<p>The most familiar names to English ears are perhaps
those of Roger Payne, Charles Hering, C. Kalthoeber,
Charles Lewis, Francis Bedford, Robert Riviere, and
Zaehnsdorf. The genuine Roger Paynes in good state are
very scarce and equally desirable. Hering excelled in
russia and half-binding. Lewis bound with equal excellence
in brown calf and Venetian morocco, and was largely
employed by Heber. Bedford had two or three periods,
of which the last was, on the whole, the best; he was
famous for his brown calf, but made it too dark at first,
instead of allowing it to deepen in colour with time.
Riviere could do good work when he took pains; but he
was unequal and uncertain.</p>

<p>Charles Lewis had been preceded by another person of
his name, who is noticed in Nichols's <i>Anecdotes</i> (iii. 465)
as dying in 1783, and as of Chelsea. This personage was
held in high esteem by his clients, and was very intimate
with Smollett the novelist, who is said to have had Lewis
in his mind, when he drew the character of Strap in
<i>Roderick Random</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[<a href="./images/247.png">247</a>]</span>
Fashions in binding, which occupy a distinct position,
are the embroidered covers in gold, silver, and variegated
threads, executed both abroad and in England, and of
which many examples are ascribed to the Nuns of Little
Gidding in Huntingdonshire; and velvet, silk, and metal
bindings, which exist in sufficient abundance, and usually
occur with marks of original ownership, lending to them a
special value. Much depends in all these instances on the
character of the work and the preservation of the copy;
and each book has to be judged on its own merits. A
considerable proportion of indifferent specimens are constantly
in the market.</p>

<p>The Little Gidding bindings are made additionally
interesting by the apparent connection between them and
John Farrer of Little Gidding, who had a principal
hand in producing a volume on Virginia entitled <i>Virgo
Triumphans</i>, of which there were three issues, 1650-51, the
last of which has the map by Goddard in two states, one
bearing the inscription: <i>John Farrer, Esq., Collegit</i>. And
the other: <i>Domina Virginia Farrer Collegit</i>. It is highly
probable that the material for the book-covers worked
by the Nunnery were obtained by the Farrers direct from
Virginia. But it may be well questioned whether the holy
ladies did more than the decorative and finishing stages.</p>

<p>The early provincial school of English binding is
chiefly remarkable for the productions of Edwards of
Halifax, who, with his two sons, James and Thomas, held
a prominent rank in the book-trade at Halifax and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[<a href="./images/248.png">248</a>]</span>
London in the last and present century, and whose name is
also recognised as that of an enthusiastic amateur. It was at
the sale of the private library of James Edwards in 1815 that
the celebrated <i>Bedford Missal</i> occurred. The bindings of
Edwards present nothing very extraordinary; but many
of them have painted edges or sides, sometimes executed
with great care and skill. A copy of the <i>History of Halifax</i>,
with a view of the place thus given on the leaves, is a
favourable illustration of a practice which was formerly
carried out on an extensive scale, and of course with very
unequal results. A brisk demand arose a short time since
for this branch of ingenuity; but it has probably ere now
subsided, having been in response to a call for the artist
by one or two collectors. Of course, the prices advanced
instantaneously to high-water mark, from the certainty
that the craze was ephemeral.</p>

<p>But the school of Edwards of Halifax probably borrowed
the idea from earlier men, who had occasionally
decorated the edges of books in this way, and we may
instance Samuel Mearne, bookbinder to Charles II., by
whom a copy of North's <i>Plutarch</i>, 1657, was clothed in a
richly gilt morocco vesture, the leaves gilt and painted
with flowers. Mearne also introduced what is known as
the cottage-roof pattern.</p>

<p>There are two fashions in the costlier department of
binding which have recommended themselves to adoption
by some connoisseurs in this country, and to which we do
not find it easy to reconcile our taste: the investiture of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[<a href="./images/249.png">249</a>]</span>
old English books in Parisian liveries and their treatment
by our own binders in the French style. Both
courses of proceeding strike us, we have to confess, as
equally unsatisfactory. There is an absence of harmony
and accord between the book and its cover, like dissonant
notes in music. At the same time, Bedford was fairly
successful in copying the French manner for foreign
works, and his productions of this class are very numerous.</p>

<p>The practice of clothing English volumes in foreign
liveries was occasionally followed in early times. Messrs.
Pearson &amp; Co. bought at Paris some years ago a lovely
copy of Queen Elizabeth's Prayer-Book, 1590, in a richly
gilt contemporary French, perhaps Lyonnese, calf binding.
The work was executed for an Englishman resident
abroad, more probably than for a local collector. But
these instances are rare. One of a different character
occurred to our notice in a copy of Whitney's <i>Choice of
Emblems</i>, printed at Leyden in 1586, and still preserved
in the old Dutch boards&mdash;old, but not coeval.</p>

<p>Of amateur binding all countries have had their
examples to show, and here we do not intend the
limitation of the artist to a particular pattern and
material chosen by his employer, such as the Hollis
plain red morocco, or the Duke of Roxburghe's half-morocco
with marbled paper sides for his old plays, but
the conduct of the whole process under the owner's roof,
as in the case of Robert Southey, whose first wife attired
many of her husband's books in cotton raiment, and led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[<a href="./images/250.png">250</a>]</span>
him to speak of them as his Cottonian library; or, nearer
to us, in that of Sir Edward Sullivan, who devotes himself
to the finishing stages of any volumes belonging
to friends or otherwise, when the article has been "forwarded"
in an ordinary workshop. Sir Edward tools,
gilds, decorates, and letters, and subscribes or inscribes
himself <i>E. S. Aurifex</i>. Specimens of his handicraft occur
fairly often in the market; as to their merit, opinions
differ. But after all, there is a <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of gratification
in having a Baronet to your binder; and we understand
that Sir Edward is complaisant enough to accept commissions
outside his personal acquaintance.</p>

<p>A second essayist in the same way, who has become
almost a member of the vocation, is Cobden Sanderson,
who bound several books of ordinary character and
moderate value for William Morris, and whose merit,
if the prices realised for the lots in the auction be any
sort of a criterion, must be extremely high. The present
writer and many others carefully examined the volumes,
and failed to see any justification for the enthusiasm
awakened in at least two competitors.</p>

<p>Specimens occur also now and then in the market of
the beautiful morocco bindings executed by another and
(as some think) superior amateur, Mrs. Prideaux. A
copy of Arnold's edition of Wordsworth's <i>Select Poems</i>,
1893, bound by this lady in Levant morocco, with elaborate
gold tooling on back and sides&mdash;only one small octavo

The Parisian differs from us islanders in these particulars
<i>toto c&aelig;lo</i>. There is an utter and hopeless incompatibility.
His predilection is for morocco <i>in genere</i>;
he estimates it not only above russia (<i>calf</i> is hardly in his
dictionary), but above even the choicest vellum encasement
to be procured or conceived; but on <i>maroquin rouge
dentell&eacute;</i> or <i>aux petits fers</i> from some pre-revolutionary
workshop he is hobbyhorsical to a pathetic extent.</p>

<p>The most celebrated French binders are carefully
enumerated by the latest authorities in their chronological
order, but there is a difficulty in respect to many
of them analogous to that encountered by the inquirer
on English ground, since the names of several even of
the best period are unknown, and the productions are
accordingly classable only under their styles or their
early owners.</p>

<p>A good deal of the finest French work is attributed
to the two Eves, whose <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i> must, and can
easily, be distinguished from the tolerably frequent
imitations put into the market from time to time, some
probably nearly coeval with the original examples.
Prior to the Eves, however, France had more or less
skilful artists in this line of industry. In the Frere sale
at Sotheby's in 1896 occurred a copy of Philelphus <i>De
Liberorum Educatione</i>, printed by Gilles Gourmont in
1508, in the original stamped leather covers, with the
name of Andr&eacute; Boule on the sides. Under Francis I.
we find the names of Estienne Roffet, <i>dit le Faulcheur</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>
as "Relieur du Roy," and also with that of Pignolet.
The initials <i>G. G.</i> occur on a volume of 1523 in Messrs.
Pearson &amp; Co.'s catalogue, 1897-98, No. 679; they are
probably those of Gilles Gourmont above mentioned.
In 1528, according to his edition of <i>Meliadus de Leonnois</i>,
Galliot du <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Pr&egrave;'">Pr&eacute;</ins> was sworn binder to the University of Paris.
In the imprint of his edition of <i>Lancelot du Lac</i>, Paris,
1533, Philippe le Noir describes himself as one of the
two sworn binders of the same University; and we gather
elsewhere that Fran&ccedil;ois Regnault was then the other.</p>

<p>When we reach the seventeenth century, greater
facilities naturally arise for identification of artists.
One of the earliest directly associated with his own
labours was Le Gascon (1620-60), followed by the
Boyets (1650-1725), Louis de Bois (1725-28), Augustin
du Seuil, (1728-46), and Andreau (binder to the queen
of Louis XV.). From the commencing years of the
eighteenth century, in addition to the binders just
enumerated, there is a fairly consecutive series, who
worked for the court and the public: Padeloup, the
two Deromes, Douceur (who was much employed by
Madame de Pompadour), the two Boz&eacute;rians, Le Monnier,
Tessier, Dubuisson (famous for his gilding), Simier,
Thompson of Paris, Cap&eacute;, Duru, Chambolle, Lesne (who
printed in 1827 a didactic poem on his craft), Trautz,
Bauzonnet, Marius-Michel, and Lortic.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the experience in every other department
of skilled labour connected with book-production,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[<a href="./images/253.png">253</a>]</span>
the French obeyed here the early influence of Italian and
German taste, and the germ was Teutonic, as in Spain
it was Moorish. The stamped leather bindings, mainly
common to Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, &amp;c., were
largely copied in England for the royal and noble libraries
of the Tudor era. In some of those executed abroad, the
artificer, as we have seen, was accustomed to place his
name or initials very conspicuously outside the cover.
Ludovicus or Lodewijk Bloc, for instance, who flourished
at Ghent or Bruges at the close of the fifteenth century,
usually signs and claims his work in an elaborate inscription.
Two specimens bear: <i>Ludovicus Bloc ob Amorem
Christi librum hunc rect&eacute; ligavi</i>. Jodocus de Lede
adopted a similar method of commemoration.</p>

<p>In the case of foreign books, especially those of
French origin, the presence of a pure and unblemished
morocco binding by a recognised artist, coupled with the
armorial cognisance or <i>ex libris</i> of some famous amateur
and the binder's ticket, which is equally <i>de rigueur</i>,
enhances the commercial importance of a volume or set
of volumes beyond calculation, and has its only analogue
in the stupendous figures paid for the S&egrave;vres soft paste
porcelain of the true epoch, when all the necessary conditions
are happily united and fulfilled. Nothing is more
striking than the immense disparity between a book in
the right sort of garniture and in the wrong one, or,
again, in the true covers with some ulterior sophistication
in the shape of added arms, restored joints, renovated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[<a href="./images/254.png">254</a>]</span>
gilding, and a hundred other subtleties difficult to detect.
The case is on all fours with a specimen of unimpeachable
S&egrave;vres contrasted with another of which the porcelain
dates back beyond the painting and the gold. A French
book in old morocco by Derome, Le Gascon, or some
other esteemed artist, with its credentials and pedigree
above suspicion, may fetch &pound;50 or double; the identical
production in old calf or in modern morocco or russia
will not bring the price of the binding; all the magic is
in the leather and the ticket. It is not a literary object,
but an article of <i>vertu</i>. There is probably no description
of Continental books which has so greatly risen in value
during the last thirty years as the illustrated publications
of the last century, provided always that they conform to
the very exacting requirements of a Parisian exquisite.
Above all, they must be of the statutory tallness and
breadth, and in the livery by bibliographical injunction
and usage prescribed.</p>

<p>No more impressive exemplification of the difference
between a book or set of books in the French series, in
the <i>right</i> and in the <i>wrong</i> state, could be afforded or
desired than the edition of Moli&egrave;re, 1773, which in
contemporary morocco may be worth &pound;100, and in calf
or any other ordinary dress a five-pound note. But
after all, a still more signal case is that of Laborde's
<i>Chansons mises en Musique</i>, published in the same year,
which, even in thoroughly preserved contemporary calf,
brings under the hammer in proof state nearly &pound;200,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[<a href="./images/255.png">255</a>]</span>
while in modern morocco it is rather dear at a quarter
of that amount.</p>

<p>The extreme rarity of pure and genuine specimens of
the work of the earliest foreign binders&mdash;nay, of our
own&mdash;has naturally produced a large inheritance of
imitations of varied character and degree. There is
nothing to save the amateur from deception but the
same kind of training which qualifies collectors in other
departments to distinguish what is true from what is false.
A man who proposes to himself to make Bindings a
speciality, cannot do better than graduate by studying
the most trustworthy and contemporary guides on the
subject in different literatures, and then we should send
him on a tour round the great public and private libraries
of Great Britain and the Continent. This, of course,
applies only where the undertaker is in thorough earnest,
and wishes to spare himself a good deal of expense and
a good deal of mortification. Illustrated catalogues are
of very indifferent value, especially those of auctioneers,
which too often offer the result of sophistication so
cleverly disguised that to an inexperienced eye the repair
is not palpable. If one goes in search of <i>desiderata</i> to
the trade, let it be to the dealer who knows his business
and charges his price, but who supplies the article, and
not to the empiric, who charges a price and does not
supply it, for the excellent reason (among others) that
this party does not know a fine binding when he sees it&mdash;or
a spurious one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[<a href="./images/256.png">256</a>]</span>
In curiosities generally it is the safest plan for a
private collector to place himself more or less in the
hands of the highest firms in the particular line which
he selects, provided that he is not one of a hundred
thousand, and is a mile or two ahead even of professional
experts. Then, wherever he goes and whatever
he buys, he is always armed <i>cap-&agrave;-pie</i>. To him, to him
solely, are the lots almost as precious as the purse
of Fortunatus; he alone it is who may fall in with
Caxtons, Clovis Eves, Rembrandts, Syracusan medallions,
for a song, and carry them home without a qualm.</p>

<p>A curious case, unique in its way, of what may be
characterised as perverted ingenuity, occurred at a public
sale in November 1897 at Sotheby's rooms. It was,
in the words of the catalogue, "A Remarkable Collection
of Magnificent Modern Bindings, Formed by an Amateur;"
but the salient feature was&mdash;in fact, the ruling one, with
one exception&mdash;that the whole of the specimens represented
imitations of ancient work and of historical copies
of early books. The interiors were authentic; they had
simply served as the medium for carrying out a rather
whimsical, not to say foolish, project, and the hundred
and ten lots, destitute of any conspicuous or genuine
interest, probably yielded very much less than the cost
of their counterfeit liveries.</p>

<p>The present volume is not a treatise on Binding, and
we can merely indicate the general bearings of this
branch and aspect of Book-Collecting, on which several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[<a href="./images/257.png">257</a>]</span>
useful, and some very sumptuous and beautiful, monographs
have appeared of recent years. An amateur
cannot do better, for purposes of reference, than secure
a copy of Mr. Quaritch's <i>Catalogue of Bindings</i>, 1888,
which includes particulars of all the principal works on
the subject, English and foreign, and one of Zaehnsdorf's
<i>Short History of Bookbinding</i>, 1895, with illustrations
of processes, and a glossary of styles and terms used in
the art. Mr. Wheatley and Mr. Brassington have also
produced monographs upon it.</p>

<p>In America, during many years past, there has been
a laudable effort to establish a national taste and feeling
in this direction; for collectors in the States formerly
made a general rule of sending their books either to
London or to Paris for treatment. The institution of
the Grolier Club of New York nearly twenty years since
was a step in the direction of independence, and its
<i>Transactions</i> form an interesting and creditable series.
The Club printed a catalogue of its library of early
typographical examples in 1895, with facsimiles of
bindings.</p>

<p>The modern French school of literary architecture
unites in the type, the paper, the illustrations such a
remarkable degree of taste and feeling, combined with
economy of production, that in England there is no
present approach to what may be termed the <i>ensemble</i>
of a volume placed in the market by our neighbours.
This style of book-making asks of course age to mellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[<a href="./images/258.png">258</a>]</span>
it, and perchance the materials employed may not bear
the test of time and manipulation by successive owners,
like the old eighteenth-century work. But as they
emerge from the workshop, and stand upon the shelves
or in the case, their aspect is decidedly agreeable, while
half a roomful of them are to be had for the price of a
Clovis Eve or even a first-rate Padeloup. Very much,
on the contrary, we are apt to conceive a dislike for that
unwieldy imperial <i>format</i> which some of the Parisian
<i>libraires editeurs</i> affect, and which perhaps occupy the
same place in French literature of the day as our detestable
English <i>editions de luxe</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two principal aids to the formation of a library,
great or small, general or special, are Personal Observation
and Works of Reference. The first is obviously an uncertain
quantity, and may be restricted to an ordinary
mechanical experience, or may comprise the finest commercial
and literary instinct. We have had among us
ere now amateurs who possessed the highest qualifications
for assembling round them gratifying and valuable monuments
of their taste and judgment, with the harmless
satisfaction of feeling tolerably sure that the investment,
if not a source of profit, would not form one of serious
loss. This is a fair and legitimate demand and expectation;
but such characters are far rarer than the books
which they collect; and if it were otherwise, the large
industry which lies in the purchase and re-sale of literary
property could not exist. The buyer whose knowledge
is in advance of that of the salesman is a party whom
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and the remainder of the alphabet
pharisaically admire, while they privily harbour toward
him sadly unchristian feelings and views.</p>

<p>The second and remaining auxiliary, the Book of
Reference, has become a wide term, since it has so enormously
developed itself, and formed branches, so as to
constitute a library within a library, and to call for its
own bibliographer. So far as the current value and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[<a href="./images/261.png">261</a>]</span>
general character of literary works are concerned, all the
older authorities are more or less untrustworthy, and
the same is to be predicated of a heavy proportion of
auctioneers' and booksellers' catalogues, where the first
and sole object is to realise the maximum price for an
article. The system pursued by the former class of
vendors of late years renders it far more hazardous to bid
on the faith of the printed descriptions, and there is, in
fact, greater danger for the novice in the elaborate rehearsal
of the title and the accompanying fillip in the
shape of a note (usually erroneous) than the good old-fashioned
plan of setting out the particulars briefly&mdash;even
illiterately; for in the latter case the burden of
discovering the exact truth is thrown on the customer
or acquirer. We must say that few things are less
satisfactory than trade-catalogues with certain honourable
exceptions, which it might be invidious to particularise;
and the book-buyer has to depend almost
exclusively on his own discernment and the bibliographers.
Of what he reads in the catalogues he may
believe as much or as little as he likes.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more ungracious than to speak
disrespectfully of the publications of those laborious and
earnest workers who have preceded us, and who for that
very sufficient reason did not know quite so much as we
do. We admire their industry, on the contrary, their taste
and their devotion; we buy their volumes because it is
pleasant to have them at our side; and ever and anon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[<a href="./images/262.png">262</a>]</span>
we dip into this one or that, and meet with something
which had escaped us. Seriously, however, they are, on
the whole, not merely of slight use, but of a misleading
tendency. For the gods of our forefathers, Ware,
Tanner, Ames, Herbert, Oldys, Dibdin, Brydges, Watt,
Park, Haslewood, the compilers of the <i>Bibliotheca Grenvillana</i>,
<i>Bibliotheca Anglo-Poetica</i>, and <i>Biographia Dramatica</i>,
and scores besides, before and even since, we have
substituted others, assuredly more complete, perhaps constructed
on truer and more lasting principles. We have
on our shelves (i.) for the <i>Bibliography</i>, the Heber, Collier,
Corser, and Huth catalogues (1834-80), and the writer's
own <i>Collections</i> (1867-1903), <i>Bibliographica</i> and the <i>Transactions
of the Bibliographical Society</i>: (ii.) for the <i>Prices</i>,
<i>Book Prices Current</i> and <i>Book Sales</i>. Unfortunately the
two latter undertakings are little better than mechanical
transcripts from the auctioneers' extremely treacherous
catalogues by outsiders. The peculiar class of information
purporting to be supplied by such catalogues
is often in need of some qualifying criticism or admonition,
which it is not easy, if possible, for any one
not on the spot and behind the scenes to offer. No
mere reference to the catalogue after the event is capable
of initiating one into these <i>arcana</i>; and the same has to
be said of the quotations in the ordinary periodicals.
This is a species of employment for which there must
be either a long training or a unique instinct.</p>

<p><i>Book Prices Current</i> and <i>Book Sales</i> cannot be trusted as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[<a href="./images/263.png">263</a>]</span>
an authority or a guide by any person who does not approach
them with a certain measure of experience. Where
an editor cites a common and comparatively worthless
volume as selling for a high sum, and omits to mention that
on the title there is a valuable autograph, the mischief
is obvious; and this and allied forms of error are habitual.
Such empirical attempts do more harm than good.</p>

<p>The Account printed by the Trustees of the Early
English books in the British Museum is not without its
value, although it is almost everything that it ought not
to have been; and there are several monographs of importance
dealing with special items in public or private
collections. It is to be hoped that in course of time we
may see a creditable catalogue of the Britwell Library,
and that the Spencer books at Manchester will be done
over again by a competent hand. If money is expended
on these objects, it is distressing to find that the task
has been confided to a gentleman whose best credentials
are his personal acquaintance with the owner.</p>

<p>We do not add to existing authorities: (i.) for the
printers, Ames, Herbert, and Dibdin, or (ii.) for general
information Lowndes's <i>Manual</i> by Bohn and his coadjutors,
because we are afraid that there is almost greater danger
of being misled by them than being helped or enlightened.
Both Ames and Herbert, however, we emphatically
pronounce conscientious, and accurate in the highest
degree in their respective days; but these days were
long ago, and the present state of knowledge has ren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[<a href="./images/264.png">264</a>]</span>dered
a considerable proportion of their texts obsolete and
unreliable. Dibdin has certainly added to Herbert, but
he has not, on the contrary, in all cases faithfully reprinted
him; if his book had been as great an advance
on his predecessor as Herbert's was on Ames, it would
have been a treasure indeed. A new Lowndes is said to
be in the hands of a syndicate. I know nothing about
it; but I shall rejoice if it should prove worthy of the
subject, and as unlike Lowndes or Lowndes by Bohn as
possible. I labour, however, under the gravest apprehension
that it will prove one of those undertakings
which will just be advanced enough to block the right
book without being relatively anything approaching even
to an English Brunet. At least five-and-twenty annotated
copies of Lowndes must exist. Will the promoters
deem it necessary to acquire or to borrow them? Probably
not. There must be thousands of additions and
corrections in the writer's alone. It is estimated that the
enlarged Lowndes contains about 10 per cent. of the
literature which ought to find a place, not reckoning the
earlier English books, tracts, or broadsides, and that of
that proportion about 7&frac12; per cent. are misdescribed. The
anecdote of Pope and the wag who retorted to his habitual
exclamation, "<i>God mend me!</i>" "It would take less to make
a new one," appears to apply in the present case.</p>

<p>The original Lowndes in 1834 was a poor affair; but
Bohn's recension twenty years or so later was by comparison
a still poorer one, for there was the opportunity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[<a href="./images/265.png">265</a>]</span>
in the presence of innumerable discoveries and a large
body of new bibliographical material in various shapes,
of rendering the new edition a really creditable performance.
The name of the publisher, however, was a sufficient
guarantee for this not being the case, and where the
second impression is superior to the first, is where Bohn
happened to have an interest in mentioning certain works,
or information was communicated to him by others.</p>

<p>The sole comfort for us is, that Brunet has passed
through five editions, and yet remains deplorably imperfect
and inaccurate.</p>

<p>There are three prominent publications, each in its
way of signal value and merit: the British Museum and
Bodleian Catalogues of Printed Books, and Mr. Quaritch's
New General Catalogue. The two former, of course
confine themselves to the contents of the respective
libraries; they are consequently far from exhaustive.
They have been compiled by human beings; they are
consequently far indeed from faultless. They express,
as a rule, no opinions, and of commercial estimation very
properly take no cognisance. But the Oxford collection
has always been differently situated from the National
Library in not having any adequate means of purchasing
deficiencies, while it is rich in its own very interesting
way by reason of bequests of unique value, making it the
possessor of numerous priceless volumes not to be found
in Great Russell Street or anywhere else. The Quaritch
Catalogue (including the <i>Typographical Supplement</i>, 1897),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[<a href="./images/266.png">266</a>]</span>
a noble monument to the energy and courage of the
<i>grand marchand</i> whose name it bears, is a good deal more
than even a bookseller's advertising medium on a large
or the largest scale. It is, in fact, a literary performance;
and it is an open secret to whom we owe it. The collector,
apart from the question of purchase, will find it
replete with useful, instructive, and trustworthy information,
so far as bibliography is concerned.</p>

<p>The highly honourable and equally laborious publications
of Sir Egerton Brydges, Joseph Haslewood,
Thomas Park, E. V. Utterson, and others, if they are of
minor substantial value to us at present, demonstrate the
keen appetite for bibliographical information and anecdote
in the first quarter of this century. The <i>Censura Literaria</i>,
extending to ten octavo volumes, passed through
two editions, and, in common with other similar works,
till recently commanded a heavy price. That they have
fallen into neglect is due to the necessity, on the part of
buyers and sellers of early literature, of studying only the
latest authorities.</p>

<p>At the same time, from a literary point of view,
the <i>Restituta</i> and <i>Censura Literaria</i> (2nd edit. 1815) of
Brydges, and many members of the same group and
period, will always be worth consulting, and will be
found to yield a vast store of interesting and instructive
matter.</p>

<p>Such works may at present be sterile enough, but
yet we are bound to recollect on their behalf that on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[<a href="./images/267.png">267</a>]</span>
their first appearance they were revelations and pioneers.
It is where a book at the outset is behind the knowledge
of the day, or indeed rather not in advance of it, that
it seems to be disentitled to respect.</p>

<p>Not only have more modern labours superseded the
Brydges, Park, Haslewood, and other series, which till
of late years held the market firmly enough, but the
Rev. Dr. Dibdin, whose sumptuously printed and illustrated
productions long remained such prime favourites
at heavy prices, both at home and in the United States,
has been overtaken by a general neglect, and the Americans,
who were once so enthusiastic and generous as
bidders for these books, will at present scarcely agree to
acquire them at a fifth of their appreciation in the height
of the Dibdinomania.</p>

<p>Many of the gems which have passed through the
hands of successive owners are known to have once formed
part of the <i>Bibliotheca Anglo-Poetica</i>, a famous&mdash;almost
historical catalogue of old literature on sale in 1815 by
Longmans, when that firm dealt in such commodities, and
imported largely from the Continent in response to the
keen and hungry demand on the part of the school
created by the Roxburghe sale and the Roxburghe Club,
Heber its greatest disciple and ornament, Heber a colossus
in himself. Many are the traditional anecdotes of the
wonderful bargains which Longmans' agent secured for his
principals in all sorts of places, whither he resorted in quest
of prey&mdash;of the romances in folio in the virgin stamped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[<a href="./images/268.png">268</a>]</span>
Spanish bindings, which they might have worn since they
lay on the shelves of Don Quixote or the Licentiate,
brought for sale, as it were haphazard, to some market-place
in Seville or Valladolid in wine-skins. But the contents
of the above-mentioned <i>Bibliotheca</i> were purely
English. It was a small but choice assemblage of old
poetry formed by Mr. Thomas Hill, otherwise Tommy
Hill, otherwise Paul Pry, which he offered to Longmans
on the plea of failing health, and for which the purchasers
elected, looking prophetically at his moribund aspect, to
grant him an annuity in preference to a round sum.
Mr. Hill's apprehensions, however, were premature, as
the transaction had the effect of restoring his spirits;
and the booksellers scored rather indifferently. How
pleased they must have been to see him coming for his
pension year after year!</p>

<p>Even the outrageous prices asked for the articles, of
which the condition was ordinarily poor, could not have
brought Longmans anywhere near home; and the catalogue
was expensively printed. Yet one would like, very
much indeed like, to put down thirty golden sovereigns
for <i>Shakespeare's Sonnets never before imprinted</i>, 1609, and
fifty for Anthony Munday's <i>Banquet of Dainty Conceits</i>,
1588. The Rev. J. M. Rice obtained the latter in 1815;
it was sold at his auction in 1834 for eighteen guineas,
and when it next occurred among George Daniel's books
in 1864, was bought by Mr. Huth against Sir William
Tite for &pound;225. The <i>Sonnets</i> of 1609 would at present be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[<a href="./images/269.png">269</a>]</span>
worth &pound;250. As regards the bulk of the lots, however,
one might almost read shillings for pounds. Sir Francis
Freeling had an interleaved copy, in which he entered
acquisitions. Through his official connection with the
Post-Office he procured many prizes from the country
districts. Dick of Bury St. Edmunds stood him in good
stead. What Dibdin euphemistically christened the <i>Lincoln
Nosegay</i> was a second pair of bellows applied about
the same date to the reddening flame of bibliographical
ardour. It was a descriptive list of certain books which
the Doctor had prevailed on the Dean and Chapter of the
Cathedral to sell to him for five hundred guineas, and
which he divided between Mr. Heber and Lord Spencer.
The collection was part of the benefaction of Dean
Honeywood, and it was a shameful betrayal of trust.
Our cathedral libraries still retain a host of treasures, notwithstanding
all this sort of pillage; and the dim religious
light which is shed around lends an air of sanctity
to the spot sufficient, one might have thought, to arrest
the hand of the marauder.</p>

<p>This was the height of the Bibliomania. Dibdin had
in 1811 brought out his work so called. Perhaps it was
hardly wise so to accentuate the passion on paper. He
lived to publish the <i>Bibliophobia</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Bibliotheca Heberiana</i>, in thirteen parts, 1834-36,
which in its realisation showed a strong revulsion, or at
least a marked decline, from the cometary period, 1812-25,
is the most stupendous assemblage of literary treasures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[<a href="./images/270.png">270</a>]</span>
and curiosities ever brought together by an individual in
this country. Heber was a scholar and a reader of his
books; he has made memoranda on a large number of
the fly-leaves; and these have been occasionally transferred
to the catalogue, of which the Early English poetical
portion, a singularly rich one, was edited and annotated
by John Payne Collier. In using the Heber Catalogue,
its mere extent and diversity ought to suffice as a warning
that the prices are not in the least degree trustworthy;
the classics and some of the early typography went pretty
high; and the Early English books were only saved from
being given away by the active competition of Mr W. H.
Miller, who secured nearly everything of account at very
moderate figures, and by the commissions held by Collier
for the Duke of Devonshire, who bought the rarest of
the old plays. The British Museum was scarcely in
evidence there. It was enjoying one of its periodical
slumbers.</p>

<p>The poetical section of the library embraced not only
the lion's share of all the rarest books of the class offered
for public sale in Heber's time, but an immense assortment
of articles which he acquired privately from Thorpe,
Rodd, and others, of whom he was the infallible resource
whenever they fell in with books or tracts or broadsides
which he did not possess, or of which he perhaps possessed
<i>only one copy</i>.</p>

<p>It was not merely that Heber distanced all that went
before him or have succeeded him, so far as the ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[<a href="./images/271.png">271</a>]</span>tent
and variety of his collections go, but that with his
insatiable acquisitiveness he combined so much of the
bibliographer and <i>litterateur</i>. It was fairly easy for certain
men with more limited means and views, such as
Malone, Steevens, Douce, Brand, Chalmers, Bright, Bliss,
Laing, Bandinel, Turner, Locker, Corser, and a legion
more, to pose as judges of the merits of their possessions;
but how comparatively little was theirs to grasp! In the
case of Heber the range of knowledge was immense; and
he was equally at home with all departments and all
periods. He had his modern side and his interest in
current affairs, and a scholarly insight into the vast literary
and bibliographical accumulations which it was his bent
and pride to form, beyond any one whom we can call to
mind. We do not include in this sort of category the
Harley, Roxburghe, Grenville, Spencer, Blandford, Ashburnham,
and Huth libraries, whose owners were collectors
pure and simple.</p>

<p>Of the Grenville Catalogue, as an independent work, it
is less usual to think and speak, because the library which
it describes has long formed part of the British Museum,
and very few are now living who can remember it under
the roof of its excellent founder in Hamilton Place. The
books have now during some years constituted an integral
part of the New General Museum Catalogue; there is
scarcely any department of literature in which they
did not contribute importantly to enrich and complete
the national stores. But Mr. Grenville was particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[<a href="./images/272.png">272</a>]</span>
strong in early typography and Irish and English
history.</p>

<p>The catalogue of Mr. George Daniel's singular and
precious collection, disposed of in 1864, was an ordinary
auctioneer's compilation; except that many of the owner's
MSS. notes written on the fly-leaves were introduced by
way of whetting the appetites of competitors; and to say
that a vein of hyperbole pervaded these remarks is a mild
expression; they emanated, we have to remember, from
an accountant. The books, however, spoke for themselves.
The printed account of them, viewed as a work of
reference, must be read <i>cum grano salis</i>&mdash;<i>cum multis
granis</i>. The sale was the starting-point of a new epoch
and school in prices. Nothing of the kind on so extended
a scale in that particular way had so far been seen
before.</p>

<p>Collier's <i>Bibliographical Catalogue</i>, 1865, is an enlargement
of his Bridgewater House Catalogue, 1837, without
the illustrations. The two volumes are full of curious
and readable matter, and as they usually deal with the
<i>libri rarissimi</i>, we have to accept the accounts and extracts
in the absence of the originals. To many this may be
indifferent; to a few it may be a serious drawback, since,
rightly or wrongly, the fidelity and accuracy of the editor
have been more than once called in question. Mr
Collier's book, however, is merely serviceable as a guide to
the character of the works described; he does not offer
an opinion on the selling values, nor does he always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[<a href="./images/273.png">273</a>]</span>
render the titles correctly. One signal fault distinguishes
the undertaking from what may be regarded as a commercial
point of view; and it is the refusal or failure to
recognise the momentous changes in the bibliographical
rank of a number of books through the discovery between
1837 and 1865 of additional copies. Like most of us
when we are advanced in life, he thought more of what
was true when he was young, than of what was so at the
time of writing.</p>

<p>The <i>Collectanea Anglo-Poetica</i> of the Rev. Thomas
Corser, in eleven parts, of which some were posthumous,
constitutes a very proud monument to the memory of an
accomplished clergyman of limited resources, who during
the best part of his life devoted his thought and surplus
money to the acquisition of one of the richest assemblages
of Early English Poetry ever formed by any one, as he
succeeded in obtaining many works in this extensive series
not comprised even in the Heber Catalogue. Mr. Corser
bought much privately; but he was largely indebted for
his bibliographical good fortune to such sales as those of
Jolley, Chalmers, Bright, and Wolfreston (1844-56). Of
his catalogue as an authority and guide the value is
unequal; the portions edited by himself are excellent and
exhaustive, but it is not so with those which Mr. James
Crossley superintended. A complete copy of the sale
catalogue is a <i>desideratum</i> for the follower in this gentleman's
footsteps; but he would have to spend more money
than Mr. Corser did by some thousands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[<a href="./images/274.png">274</a>]</span>
Of the Huth Catalogue, 1880, we can only say that
it is a splendid gathering in a comparatively short period
of various classes of books obtained from the sales in
London and elsewhere, and from private sources, and
selected on account of condition and interest rather
than with a view to completeness. In its character it
is emphatically miscellaneous; but is very strong in
Early English literature, owing to the opportunities
which the founder enjoyed through the dispersion in
his time of so many fine libraries of that class, especially
those of Daniel and Corser, and perhaps we may add
of George Smith the distiller. But there was scarcely
any sale here or on the Continent from which Mr. Huth
was not enabled to add to his stores. He was a very rich
man; but he was not a book-hunter, and he was both
inconsistent and capricious. He had, in fact, no definite
plan, and took each purchase on its own merits. His
Catalogue, which he did not live to see completed,
is unusually free from errors, but not quite so much
so as he anticipated and desired. Nevertheless, it
will always be an useful guide and an honourable
memorial.</p>

<p>Several monographs, dealing in a brief or cursory way
with an entire library, or more fully with a section of it,
may be noticed. The Ashburnham hand-list, 1864, now
(1897-98) supplemented by the sale catalogue; the Chatsworth
Catalogue, which does not include the books at
Devonshire House, and Lord Crawford's catalogue of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[<a href="./images/275.png">275</a>]</span>
Ballads and Broadsides. There are special accounts of
several of the College Libraries at Oxford and Cambridge,
as well as Hartshorne's <i>Book Rarities</i>, 1829, a disappointing
yet suggestive volume. We ought to remind the
reader that the catalogue of Trinity, Cambridge, embraces
Capell's <i>Shakesperiana</i>, and that there are separate hand-lists
of Malone's and Douce's books at the Bodleian, of
the Dyce and Forster bequests at South Kensington,
of the Society of Antiquaries' Broadsides, and of the
Shakespearian treasures formerly at Hollingbury Copse.
We have two editions of Blades's book on Caxton's press,
Maitland's two Lambeth Catalogues, Botfield's <i>Cathedral
Libraries</i>, and Edmond's Lists of the Aberdeen printers,
1886.</p>

<p>It is eminently likely that of the Rylands-Spencer
library we shall have in the fulness of time a new
catalogue, superseding Dibdin's publications, and of
course embracing all the personal acquisitions of Mrs.
Rylands, apart from the grand Althorp lot. In the
capable hands of Mr. Duff it ought to turn out well.</p>

<p>In the <i>Book Lover's Library</i>, Mr. H. B. Wheatley has
dedicated two or three volumes to the topic of forming
and cataloguing a library. The object of these technical
undertakings is clearer, perhaps, than their general
utility; for, as a rule, a man likes to follow his own
plan, and scarcely two normal collections of the average
kind resemble one another, or are susceptible of similar
treatment. The idea broached by Mr. Wheatley was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[<a href="./images/276.png">276</a>]</span>
of course, not a new one. Gabriel Naude, librarian to
Cardinal Mazarin, and subsequently keeper of the Royal
Collection, printed a sketch of what in his opinion was
necessary to constitute a library, and this our Evelyn
put into an English dress in 1661, and dedicated to
Lord Clarendon. The plan of Naude was naturally that
of a Frenchman accustomed to extensive assemblages of
literary monuments, and was not suited to the English
taste, unless it might be in the case of a rich nobleman,
to whom space and cost were alike indifferent. It was
not likely to meet with adoption even by Evelyn
himself, of whose acquisitions we know enough to judge
that he followed his own personal sentiments rather
than professional or technical advice. It rarely occurs
that in the less ambitious types of library there are any
bibliographical details likely to prove serviceable to the
public; and the extent of knowledge gained by the
owner in the course of his own experience should suffice
to qualify him to become, where time is presumably not
an object, his own cataloguer. For all that can be
required is a hand-list on the scale of the Douce or
Malone separate catalogues, where a title seldom occupies
more than a single line. Plentiful illustrations of our
meaning will be found by any one who opens the Grenville
or Huth Catalogue, and perceives the wide discrepancy
between the essential information and the descriptive
and critical accounts. The primary motive in drawing
up a view of the contents of ninety-nine libraries out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[<a href="./images/277.png">277</a>]</span>
of a hundred is the facilitation of reference, combined
with an excusable personal pride; but a great deal
of repetition and redundancy and useless expense are
incurred by the literal transcript of the titles of
books more or less familiar to all who are interested
in them.</p>

<p>A very heavy proportion of the Early English entries
in the Huth Catalogue are duplicates of those in the
writer's <i>Collections</i>, and the same would be the case if
the long-expected book on the Britwell heirlooms were
to make its appearance. It would be, to a large extent,
<i>bis cocta</i>.</p>

<p>In a private catalogue detailed explanation is required
in the interest of bibliography, only where (i.) the owner
happens to possess an unrecorded book; or (ii.) an unknown
impression; or (iii.) a variant copy. Defects in
important items should be particularised; in others the
word <i>imperfect</i> is sufficient; and it is best to indicate
from what source they have come to the immediate
repository. Take a few instances:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Reynard the Fox, 1st edit. The Inglis copy. Folio, W. Caxton,
Westminster, 1481.</p>

<p>Hannay (Patrick), Poems. The Huth copy. 8vo, London, 1622.</p>

<p>Holinshed (Raphael), Chronicles, 2 vols. The Sunderland copy.
Wants the plan of Edinburgh Castle. Folio, London, 1577.</p>

<p>Shakespeare (W.), Plays, 1st edit. The Napier copy, wanting
the verses. Folio, London, 1623.</p></div>

<p>The notation of differences in copies of the same book,
even if it is not one of supreme value, is always apt to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[<a href="./images/278.png">278</a>]</span>
useful. Of literary comment the supply is discretionary,
so long as it is new, pertinent, and interesting. The
transfer to the catalogue of any inedited manuscript
matter on the fly-leaves or margins, or of any proprietary
marks, is eminently desirable.</p>

<p>For French literature, which is so largely collected in
England, the <i>Manuel du Libraire</i>, &amp;c., of Brunet, 7 vols.
8vo, 1860-78, with the works of Cohen and Gay, is the
standard authority. The two latter, so far as they go,
are more exhaustive than the <i>Manuel</i>, which is nearly
as incomplete as our Lowndes, and not much more
accurate. A new edition has been mooted; it is a clear
<i>desideratum</i>. For value Brunet is scarcely more serviceable
than its English analogue, and the book is, curiously
enough, particularly unsafe in such a field as the French
books of former times, where so much depends on
factitious conditions barely intelligible to an ordinary
English or American consulter.</p>

<p>Two books which perhaps equally appeal to the
English and Continental collectors are those just mentioned:
Cohen, <i>Guide de l'Amateur de Livres &agrave; Gravures
du XVIII<sup>th</sup> si&egrave;cle</i>, 5<sup>me</sup> ed. 8<sup>o</sup>, 1886-90, and Gay, <i>Bibliographie
des Ouvrages relatifs &agrave; l'Amour, aux Femmes, au
Mariage, et des Livres Fac&eacute;tieux</i>, 3<sup>me</sup> ed. 12<sup>o</sup>, 1871, 6 vols.
Both, but especially the first, are essential for guidance in
the choice of a class of publication of which the innumerable
variations and the artificial prices necessitate the
utmost caution on the part of an intending buyer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[<a href="./images/279.png">279</a>]</span>
There are, in fact, no topics to which an amateur or
student can direct his notice or limit himself where he
will not have been preceded, so to speak, by a path-finder;
nor does the narrowness of the range always
ensure brevity or compactness of treatment, since the
Schreiber <i>Playing Cards of all Countries and Periods</i>,
which to a certain extent enter into the literary category,
occupy in the Account by Sir A. W. Franks three folio
volumes; but a satisfactory view of the subject is to be
gained from the works by Singer and Chatto, 1816-48.
As a rule, editors of this class of publication are more
modest and compressed. There are the bibliographies
on Angling by J. R. Smith and Westwood; on Tobacco,
by Bragge (1880); on Dialect books, by J. R. Smith (at
present capable of great expansion); on Bewick, by Hugo;
on Bartolozzi, by Tuer; on Tokens, by Williamson and
by Atkins; on Coins and Medals, by a numerous body
of gentlemen specified in a section of the writer's <i>Coin
Collector</i>, 1896. In the English and American series
are the well-known volumes by Henry Stevens and by
Sabin, and the sumptuous catalogue of the early Laws
and Statutes by Mr. Charlemagne Tower. In the
Chetham Society's series, Mr. Jones, late Chetham's
Librarian, printed an elaborate list of all the old English
books and tracts relating to Popery.</p>

<p>There are many ways in which compilers of works of
reference are in danger of perpetuating mistakes as to
books, where they rely on secondary authorities. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[<a href="./images/280.png">280</a>]</span>
account of an old book is, in the first place, entitled to
credence unless it has been drawn up by the describer
with the book itself before him; and when it is considered
that not one individual in ten thousand can even then
be trusted to copy what is under his eyes, and that
there are, and always have been, those who have thought
fit to exercise their ingenuity by falsifying dates
and other particulars, there cannot be much room for
surprise that our bibliographies, and those of every other
people, are partly made up of material which never
existed. Errors are heirlooms, of which it is hard to
get rid.</p>

<p>The extent to which rare books are multiplied, as
regards varieties of impression, by misdescriptions in
catalogues, is remarkable and serious, and the bibliographer
is not unfrequently confronted with statements
of his ignorance of copies in sales of which he has not
thought it worth while to indicate the true facts. But
it is our individual experience that it is impossible to be
too minute in pointing out snares for the unwary, and
indeed for all who work at second-hand.</p>

<p>The Club or Society for the communication to members,
and through them to the public generally, of literary
and arch&aelig;ological material previously existing only
in MS. or in unique printed copies, was at the outset very
restricted in its zone and its scope; but, in spite of the
circumscribed interest felt by general readers in the more
abstruse or obscure provinces of research, the movement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[<a href="./images/281.png">281</a>]</span>
at first confined to scholars and patrons of literature,
at length became universal in its range and distribution.
There is no country pretending to culture without several
of these institutions. In Great Britain, France, Italy,
the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, they have
long abounded. They have rendered accessible an enormous
body of inedited or unknown material for history,
arch&aelig;ology, and biography; and after all deductions for
indiscretion and dilettantism, they may be pronounced
the medium for having shed new and precious light on
well-nigh all branches of human science. To the book-collector
they appeal less in a possessory sense than as
works of reference. Where they enter into his plan is
in the practice, which some of them have followed, of
striking off on vellum or other special substance half a
dozen copies, which from their <i>presqu' uniquity</i> (this is
as good a phrase as <i>rarissime</i>) have ere now bred unchristian
sentiments among competitors for the <i>bijoux</i> in the
<i>belles lettres</i>. The book-hunter's motto is <i>Pulchra qu&aelig;
difficilia</i>; he reverses the common saying.</p>

<p>There is so far no exhaustive Guide to the Club
literature, but the supplementary volume to Bohn's
<i>Lowndes</i> contains a fairly complete view of it down to
1869. The additions since that date have been incessant
and almost innumerable. The British Museum General
Catalogue registers them all under the medi&aelig;val heading
of <i>Academies</i>.</p>

<p>It is right and necessary that the inexperienced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[<a href="./images/282.png">282</a>]</span>
collector should be put on his guard against the reprehensible
and dishonest practice of some professional
vendors in advertising or offering for disposal books
of which the leaves are not entirely genuine, which are
deficient in supplemental matter recognised as part of
the work, or whose bindings are sophisticated in a manner
only capable of detection by a connoisseur or a specialist.
There are wily persons who systematically and habitually
insert in their catalogues items which they have acquired
with the distinct proviso that they were defective, and
have naturally acquired at a proportionate price. The
forms of deception are infinitely various; but the leading
points demanding attention and verification are apt
to be:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>The Frontispiece.</li>
<li>The Portrait.</li>
<li>The Half-title.</li>
<li>The Errata.</li>
<li>Supplement or Postscript.</li>
<li>Starred pages.</li>
<li>Extra sheets inserted.</li>
<li>Plates.</li>
<li>Extra Plates.</li>
</ul>

<p>The intending purchaser must take care to satisfy
himself that there are no facsimile or reprinted leaves,
no catchword erased to cancel a deficiency, no mixture
of editions, and no wrong or re-engraved portrait or
frontispiece, or false date inserted or inconvenient one
erased; and that the copy has not been unskilfully
cleaned. It is <i>caveat emptor</i> indeed.</p>

<p>The most surprising pains are undertaken by certain
persons to mislead the collector who is not very much
indeed on his guard, and who yearns for the possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[<a href="./images/283.png">283</a>]</span>
of some current prize. A case lately occurred in which
the well-known copy of the scarce portrait of Milton,
with the famous verses beneath it, attached to the first
edition of the <i>Poems</i> in 1645, had been actually split
and laid down on old paper to make it resemble the
original print, and in the same way a plate belonging to
Lovelace's <i>Lucasta</i>, 1649, representing Lucy Sacheverell,
being frequently deficient, and making a good deal of
the value of the book, has been ere this soaked off from
the modern reproduction in Singer's <i>Select Poets</i>, and
"lined" to communicate to it the aspect of a genuine
impression mounted.</p>

<p>Other forms of deception and danger lie in the exact
reproduction of ancient or early books, not always with
any mischievous or fraudulent intention. Such a piece
of <i>superch&egrave;rie</i> as the <i>History of Prince Radamanthus</i>,
professedly re-printed from a unique copy by Wynkyn
de Worde, or the <i>Life and Death of Mother Shipton</i>,
dated 1687, and actually issued in the latter half of the
last century, are scarcely apt to impose on any but
the most unobservant. It stands differently, however,
with the <i>Declaratioun of the Kings maiesties intention
and meaning toward the lait acts of parliament</i>, 1585,
republished in 1646 in facsimile: with Marlowe's <i>Ovid</i>,
originally printed in 1596, and repeatedly brought out
without any change in the text down to 1630: with Sir
John Hayward's <i>Life of Henry IV.</i>, 1599, similarly reproduced,
and (in French literature) with the eighteenth-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[<a href="./images/284.png">284</a>]</span>century
edition of the works of Rabelais, purporting to
have come from the Lyons press in 1558. These difficulties
require on the part of buyers one of two things:
an experienced eye or a trustworthy counsellor. The
version of Ovid's <i>Elegies</i> by Marlowe in a re-issue of no
value is constantly sold for the right one, suppressed by
authority, although Dyce, in his edition of the poet, 1850,
points out the differences. One has to study not merely
the external characteristics of an old book, but the paper,
water-mark, type. It is scarcely conceivable that the
reprint by Pepys of the <i>Order of the Hospital of St.
Bartholomew</i>, 1557, could be mistaken for the genuine
impression; the paper and type alike betray it.</p>

<p>A curious and long-lived misapprehension prevails
respecting certain works from the press of Thomas
Berthelet, at the foot of the title-pages of which we find
the date 1534; but the latter forms part of the woodcut
in which the letterpress is enclosed, and was retained
in publications posterior to the year named, and the
same is, to a slighter extent, the case with Robinson's
<i>Reward of Wickedness</i>, where the figures 1573 occur at
the end within an engraved border employed for other
purposes, the particular production by one of the guards
set over Mary, Queen of Scots, having probably appeared
some years after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fluctuations and revolutions in the mercantile value
of old English books present phenomena to our consideration
of an instructive and occasionally of a tantalising
character. No one has the power to foresee what
future changes time may bring forth. It is the fashion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[<a href="./images/286.png">286</a>]</span>
with the vendor to force a purchase on his client, because,
says he, this book cannot recur for sale, or this class of
books is rising; but that is a <i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>, nothing
more. We are apt to sigh over the times when unique
Caxtons could be had&mdash;ay, in our grandsires' time&mdash;for
less than &pound;20. In the sixteenth century twenty pence
paid for them. But let us recollect that our estimation
of an article depends on its cost so largely. What we
acquire cheaply we hold cheaply. Should we have heard
of many of our great modern collectors had old quotations
survived? We have known personally one or two who
would not dream of taking a volume at a low price; you
had, as it were, to adjust it to their meridian. They
failed to perceive how anything could be worth having if
it was to be secured for a song. A hundred-dollar author
might be barely admissible; a dollar man would be a
disgrace to the collection.</p>

<p>As regards the strange vicissitudes of the tariff for
second-hand books prices, there is an illustrative note from
Robert Scott, the celebrated dealer, to Pepys, dated June
30, 1688, where he offers his customer four books for
34s., namely:&mdash;</p>

<div class='centered'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Campion and Others' "History of Ireland"</td><td align='right'>12</td><td align='right'>0</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>Barclay's "Ship of Fools" [1570]</td><td align='right'>8</td><td align='right'>0</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The value set on the second and fourth items would
now, if they were poor copies, be vastly in excess of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[<a href="./images/287.png">287</a>]</span>
the figures named by Scott; but for the other two a
bookseller of the present day might not expect much
more than Pepys was asked more than two hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>The anecdotes of bargains picked up from day to day
at the present time are plentiful, and (except for the fortunate
finder) exasperating enough. But if we go back
to a period when there were no auctions, no organised
book dep&ocirc;ts, no newspapers, no railways and other such
facilities, and men lived practically in separate communities,
there can be no feeling of astonishment that our
own early literature, like that of all other countries, has
descended to us in an almost inconceivably shrunk volume.
Books, and more especially pamphlets and broadsheets,
were acquired, and, after perusal, flung away. There
were not only no booksellers, in our sense, but down to
the seventeenth century no systematic book-buyers. The
library, as we understand the term and the thing, is a
comparatively modern institution. Even the products
of the Caxton press, very early in the next century, had
sunk in commercial value to almost nothing; they were
procurable for pence, nor did they acquire any appreciation
till the reign of George III. and the rise of a new
school of collectors, amongst whom we have to reckon the
King himself.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to hear cases of cheap books having
been acquired by the normal buyer in the open market.
A friend tells you that he has bought such or such a volume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[<a href="./images/288.png">288</a>]</span>
of a dealer&mdash;perhaps a specialist in that line&mdash;a positive
bargain; he was not very keen on purchases just at the
moment, but he could not resist this. It may be so; but
it is exceedingly problematical. If we were to inquire
into the facts, one might, nay, one would almost certainly,
find that the specialist had secured the item over all competitors
at a recent auction, and had added his own
profit. If he had not been present, the item would not
have brought half. He was deemed rash by his <i>confr&egrave;res</i>
for giving so much. Of course there were two in
it; but the under-bidder was, maybe, a second private
enthusiast, who had gone to the full extent of his ideas
or resources. Where, then, is the bargain?</p>

<p>The more or less artificial quotations at first-class
auctions partly arise, no doubt, from the preference of certain
private buyers for dispensing with the middle-man
in the person of the bookseller. They do not object to
employ him as an agent, and often enable him to secure
their <i>desiderata</i> against all comers; but they somehow
distrust him as an independent valuer of what he may
offer over the counter; and this is, we fear, usually
attributable to their diffidence of their own judgment
and experience. There is a prevailing idea&mdash;it may be
a prejudice&mdash;that in the salerooms an article fetches its
worth and no more, and that you save the relative profit.
You may or you may not. In the majority of cases,
where the actual purchaser has no practical knowledge,
and his resources are ample, the saleroom is a dearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[<a href="./images/289.png">289</a>]</span>
market than the shop, if the property offered is that of
an eminent person and is of high character; and even in
obscurer sales bargains of any moment are only to those
who are experts and are on the spot.</p>

<p>The prices or market values of the older and rarer
books form a debateable ground, on which those interested
will probably never arrive at anything approaching unanimity;
and the reason or part of the reason seems to be
that the actual realised figure depends on so many considerations,
of which the mere character of the article
put up for sale is not invariably the most influential.
There is no species of weather-glass more sensitive than
the bibliographical one; it responds to the slightest
change in the commercial temperature, and must be
carefully watched and studied by all who either seek to
sell at a profit or to buy without the risk of serious loss
on eventual realisation. Two books belonging to the
same edition, bound in the same style by the same
person, are they not one as good as the other? By no
means necessarily so. Setting aside the extrinsic features
which confer arbitrary value on literary property, one
of the copies may have the start of the other, if it is
something then in active or general demand; one may
occur when the trade has a glut of stock, or has exhausted
its credit at the auctioneer's; one may belong
to a "genuine" collection, while the other may labour
under the suspicion of being "rigged." Place them
side by side; there does not appear to be sixpence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[<a href="./images/290.png">290</a>]</span>
between them, yet under the hammer one lot may fetch
twice as much as the other.</p>

<p>This, it may be fairly argued, tells against the wisdom
and security of laying out money by collectors of moderate
resources on such doubtful investments; but look
in whatever direction you please, and you will encounter
similar phenomena. The buyer of coins, china, pictures,
or any other curiosities, meets with an identical experience.
Immense sums are lost in these recreations by one
class to provide livelihoods, and very handsome livelihoods,
too, for thousands and tens of thousands year by
year. Sometimes the amount is not serious to the individual,
or he can afford it; occasionally it is otherwise.</p>

<p>Prices fluctuate, and their fluctuation is apt to be
deceptive. It is not merely the article which has to be
considered, but the atmosphere in which it was sold.
No one can be sure that he has secured a bargain till
he sells it. At the Beckford sale the Thuanus copy of
Buchanan's <i>Poemata</i>, 1579, fetched &pound;54; a year or two
later it was offered at &pound;18, and in 1897 it occurs in a
catalogue at &pound;42. A rare theatrical item in the Mackenzie
sale produced &pound;62, 10s. In another in 1897 a
second copy formed part of a bundle which brought 14s.
At the Laing sale Beza's <i>Confession of Christian Faith</i>,
in Italian, 1560, said to have been the property of Mary
Queen of Scots, was carried to &pound;149. After being kept
by the purchaser many years, it realised during the current
year &pound;52. The <i>&eacute;clat</i> which accompanied these books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[<a href="./images/291.png">291</a>]</span>
on their original realisation was absent, or was no more
than a tradition. Some judged the Queen of Scots
volume very dear even at the lower quotation. We
saw it knocked down, and such was our own judgment.</p>

<p>These samples we adduce for the advantage of ordinary
purchasers of literary property, whose estimation
principally depends on its <i>provenance</i>. There is an inherent
proneness to shrinkage of interest and value in the
hands of any one who is not equally celebrated, or is not
going to become so.</p>

<p>Even an approximately accurate appreciation in a
commercial sense of books of various classes can only
be reached by one who is behind the scenes, who can
feel the pulse of the market, and who follows the incessant
changes in its temperature and feeling. It is absurd
for a simple amateur, who passes his time in a study or
an office, to attempt or presume to instruct us on this
subject. He knows what he has given for his own
library, and what some of his friends have given for
theirs, and he reads the accounts in the papers of
periodical sales. But it is a widely different affair, when
one sets about the task, intrusted to this or that individual
by a friendly publisher or editor-general, in a
scientific manner; and it is only under such circumstances
that one realises, or can render intelligible to
others, what prices actually mean and are, how much
they depend on perpetually modifying and varying influences,
and how little the quotations found in works of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span>
reference are to be trusted. The turns of the book-market
are as sudden and strange, as delicate and mysterious,
as those of a Bourse; and the steadfast and keen
onlooker alone can keep pace with them&mdash;not he always;
the wire-pullers are so many.</p>

<p>How, then, shall collectors of books, for example, protect
themselves? They cannot. It is their diversion,
their by-play; their time and thought are engaged elsewhere
in business, where it is their turn to reap the fruit
of special study and experience, and they hand over a
percentage of this to the caterer for their pleasure. The
whole world is, in other words, perpetually intent on
gathering and distributing; we are, every one of us,
buyers and sellers, not of necessaries only, but of luxuries
and amusements.</p>

<p>Coming to the more immediate point, men nowadays,
in the presence of a severe and almost homicidal competition
for subsistence, have to devote their whole attention
to their chosen employment, and have the most
limited opportunities of ascertaining or verifying values
as submitted to them by experts in the book-market;
they have Lowndes, which is almost worthless, and <i>Book
Prices Current</i>, which is, of course, more contemporary,
but must be read between the lines; and the extreme
difficulty of judging what is worth having, and how much
should be given for it, has led to that frequent habit of
collectors favouring a particular dealer, or, as an alternative,
pursuing a policy highly unpleasant to dealers by acquiring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[<a href="./images/293.png">293</a>]</span>
direct from the salerooms. Fortunately for booksellers
the latter plan does not suit busy men, and it is just
that class, especially the merchant and the stockbroker,
the solicitor and accountant, who are their best clients.</p>

<p>The trade has its sorrows and trials; but it cannot be
a very bad one when we see how many live out of it, if
they do not often make fortunes. The fact is, that the
motives for buying books are almost as infinitely multifarious
as the books themselves, and there exists not the
volume for which the customer will not arise, if the holder
can wait; and this customary incidence accounts for the
familiar aphorism that booksellers accumulate stock, not
money&mdash;an aphorism to which the exceedingly rare exceptions
prove the rule.</p>

<p>Putting it differently, bookselling outside the current
literature is a form of speculation which varies according
to the class of investment which the stockholder selects;
and it is quite necessary to bear in mind the nature and
tendency of the business in order to more clearly
appreciate the uncertainty of prices, and how utterly
impossible it must ever be for any ordinary book-buyer
to rely on his purchases as a representation of value. If
he does not view the matter in that light, or chooses to
let the instruction or pleasure derived from his acquisitions
become a set-off against the outlay, it is very well; what
he or his heirs get for the property is in that case all
profit.</p>

<p>We dwell a little on this aspect of the matter, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[<a href="./images/294.png">294</a>]</span>
we are quite aware that in purchasing books many persons
look at the ulterior question, and even demand of the
vendor how much the article is likely to bring when or if
re-sold. Such a contingency usually limits itself to cases
where a volume is secured for a special and temporary
object, or where funds are restricted and the fancy is
purely personal.</p>

<p>Apart from these considerations, there are other influences
always at work to render the book-market uncertain
and insecure. Collectors who have no fixed plan
or aim are apt to follow the precedent set by such as
have, or are supposed to have, one, and this obviously
tends to create a run on particular subjects or authors,
till the call is satisfied, or the <i>coterie</i> grows sensible of the
inexpediency of proceeding any further. A revolt from a
fad naturally gluts the market with the discarded copies,
and the latest vendors have to bear the brunt. Such is not
an occasional incidence, but one continually in progress
among a certain <i>quota</i>, and a large <i>quota</i>, too, of the book-buying
public, who let others judge for them, instead of
judging for themselves.</p>

<p>It cannot be treated as otherwise than an ordinary
and reasonable <i>sequitur</i> that prices which are purely
artificial are also arbitrary and precarious. The quotations
which are to be found in such a publication as <i>Book
Prices Current</i> are at best a bare record of facts; but
with such a record at his elbow no man who does not
possess a fair amount of knowledge and judgment would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[<a href="./images/295.png">295</a>]</span>
be safe in his figures. It would be little better than
plunging. Still less is it of any use to rely on the
reports in the press, which are frequently inaccurate, and
in nine cases out of ten are the work of inexperienced
persons.</p>

<p>The careful and discerning observer of these problems
(for such they indeed are) discovers that the high prices
for books, which the trade is never tired of citing as an
encouragement to its connections, are almost invariably
associated with conditions which are adventitious or
accidental, and which scarcely ever comprise benefit to a
living individual. A man must be truly exceptional,
phenomenally above suspicion, bedridden with an incurable
complaint, to disarm the scepticism of the wary buyer
under the hammer; it is the property of the departed
which is preferred; for the result cannot help him, and he
is not at hand to reserve lots. So recently as 1896,
there was an exception to the prevailing rule; but it was
one rather in appearance than in reality. We allude to
the <span class="smcap">Frere</span> sale at Sotheby's. Now, we repeat that this
was merely an ostensible departure from ordinary experience;
and what we mean is that the most valuable portion
of the library was that which once belonged to another
and antecedent person, Sir John Fenn, and that these
items had been long known to exist, and were <i>desiderata</i>
for which public and private collections had hitherto
thirsted in vain. No wonder, then, that there was a dead
set at them, the living owner <i>maulgre</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[<a href="./images/296.png">296</a>]</span>
The booksellers are apt to complain nowadays of their
inability to move or place items with which they cannot
give a certificate of character. It will not always suffice
to allege that they have realised a great deal of money
heretofore, as vouched by Lowndes; they must carry with
them some definite recommendation; they must exhibit
remarkable allusions; they may be written by an ancestor
or namesake of the buyer in view; at all events, if they
are not by a good author, they must be on a good subject.
Their interest must be (1) personal; (2) local; or (3)
topical. There is a drift on the part of collectors of the
purer type toward accredited and certified securities&mdash;toward
recognised writers. Established character goes
for more than mere rarity. The trade can always place
fine copies of authors who have made their personality
standard: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Sydney, Jonson,
Milton, Butler, Swift, Thomson, Goldsmith, Miss Burney,
Dr. Johnson, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Sir Walter Scott,
Charles Lamb, Shelley, Keats, Thackeray, George Eliot.
If to the more fastidious or self-diffident amateur an
excessively rare item is introduced without credentials, it
is in danger of being rejected; the same principle applies
to certain foreign writers, such as Cervantes, Montaigne,
Moli&egrave;re, Corneille, La Fontaine. But in almost all these
cases the demand is not for collected or library editions, or
even for first copies of everything coming from the pens
of those writers. Chaucer has to be served up in the
types of Caxton or De Worde or Pynson; Spenser is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[<a href="./images/297.png">297</a>]</span>
only sought in quarto and octavo; Shakespeare means
the four folios and certain quartos, and the Poems in
octavo; the leading aim in Sydney is the <i>Arcadia</i> of
1590; Jonson is just admissible in folio (the right
one), but is preferred in quarto; by Milton we mean
the <i>Comus</i>, <i>Lycidas</i>, <i>Poems</i>, <i>Paradise Lost</i> and <i>Paradise
Regained</i> in the original issues. Butler is only represented
by his <i>Hudibras</i>; Swift by his <i>Gulliver</i>; Defoe by his
<i>Crusoe</i> (some must have all three volumes, although the
first is worth nearly all the money); Thomson by the
<i>Seasons</i>; Goldsmith by the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>; Miss
Burney by one or two of her Novels in boards; Dr.
Johnson by his <i>Rasselas</i>; Scott by the <i>Waverley</i> series
with uncut edges, and so forth.</p>

<p>The actual current appreciation of old books seems to
be, to a large and increasing extent, in the ratio of their
literary or artistic attraction; and under the second head
we comprise typography and wood-engraving; and we
think that we could establish that, as a rule, the highest
bids in modern days are for something of which the
reputation or importance, or both, are a matter of
tacit acknowledgment and acceptance. A merely <i>curious</i>
volume may fetch money; but it must be something
beyond that to make the pulse beat more quickly and
form a record.</p>

<p>Two considerations govern and recommend such a
course&mdash;those of commercial expediency and of space.
There is not much probability that in the time to come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[<a href="./images/298.png">298</a>]</span>
book-buyers will arise to renew the traditions of the
Harleian and Heber libraries, or even of such vast heterogeneous
assemblages of literary monuments as those formed
by Sir Thomas Phillipps, James Crossley, Joseph Tasker,
Gibson-Craig, and a few others. The feeling is more in
favour of the French view&mdash;small and choice; and there
is no doubt that, as a rule, the sale of a collection should
not occupy more than three days. Beyond that time the
interest flags and prices are apt to recede.</p>

<p>At the same time there has always been, and will be,
a powerful curiosity in the direction of knowing or hearing
what certain rare or superlatively important books
occasionally bring. The feeling is rather more general
than might be imagined, for it extends to those who are
not collectors, yet like to see how foolish other people are,
or, again, store up the information, in case they should
have the good fortune to meet with similar things in their
travels. When one thinks of the extraordinary casualities
which have brought to light undescribed works or editions,
and continue to do so year by year, there is no reason to
despair of completing ourselves in due course in many and
many a direction. The tendency in prices of late has
certainly been favourable to books which are at once
rare and admittedly important; and we have said that
the latter feature and quality appear to be weightier
than mere unfrequency of occurrence. For instance, any
given number of copies of such comparatively common
volumes as the first folio Shakespeare, the first <i>Fa&euml;ry</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[<a href="./images/299.png">299</a>]</span>
<i>Queen</i>, the first <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Herrick, Beaumont and
Fletcher, will present themselves in the market and command
steadily advancing figures; it is the same with Pope
and Dryden in a measure, and with some of the more
eminent moderns. The literary <i>&eacute;clat</i> stimulates the
biddings.</p>

<p>Those works which represent the maximum value
during recent years have been:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i.) The earliest examples of printing, at all events in
book-form; <i>Miss&aelig; Speciales</i>, and other smaller books
executed by Gutenberg previous to 1455, or at all
events to the Bible ascribed to that date; Gutenberg's
Bible, otherwise known as the Mazarin Bible, 1455,
re-issued by Fust and Schoeffer in 1456; the Psalters of
1457 and 1459, designed for the Cathedral and Benedictine
monastery of Mainz respectively; the <i>Chronicles</i> of
Monstrelet on vellum; <i>Lancelot du Lac</i> on vellum, 1488;
the Sarum <i>Missal</i>, 1492, 1497, 1504; Caxton's two <i>Troy-Books</i>,
two <i>Jasons</i>, <i>Arthur</i>, <i>Speculum Vit&aelig; Christi</i> and
<i>Doctrinal of Sapience</i> on vellum, <i>Canterbury Tales</i> and
other separate works of Chaucer, <i>Paris and Vienne</i>, &amp;c.;
<i>Book of St. Albans</i>, 1486, and other works printed there,
1480-1534; Tyndale's <i>New Testament</i>, 1526; Coverdale's
<i>Bible</i>, 1535; Boece's <i>Chronicles of Scotland</i> on vellum, 1536;
the Huth Ballads; Montaigne's <i>Essais</i>, 1580; the same in
English, 1603, 1613; Spenser's <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, 1590-96; Constable's
<i>Diana</i>, 1592; Bacon's <i>Essays</i>, 1597, 1598; Shakespeare's
<i>Venus and Adonis</i>, <i>Lucrece</i>, 1st quartos, <i>Sonnets</i>, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[<a href="./images/300.png">300</a>]</span>
the collected <i>Plays</i>, 1593-1623. (ii.) Shelton's <i>Don
Quixote</i>, 1612-20; first editions of Daniel, Drayton, Lodge,
Watson, Barnfield, Breton, &amp;c.; Milton's <i>Comus</i>, 1637,
<i>Lycidas</i>, 1638, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, 1667; Walton's <i>Complete
Angler</i>, 1653, Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, 1678, and
any other capital or standard authors of the seventeenth
century, particularly Lovelace, Carew, Suckling, down to
Locke's <i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i>, which, though
a common book, has lately grown a dear one by sheer
force of companionship.</p>

<p>There seems a disposition to look more indifferently
on volumes which have no certificate or passport. Secondarily,
as in the case of Florio's version of Montaigne,
items are admitted as hangers-on and interpreters of
great authors.</p>

<p>The last copy of the <i>Fa&euml;ry Queen</i>, 1590-96, offered for
sale, an extraordinarily fine one, brought &pound;84, of <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>, &pound;75. The British Museum paid for the <i>Book
of Common Prayer</i>, 1603, a year earlier than any edition
so far described, &pound;175. It was obtained by the vendor
from a sale at Sotheby's, where its liturgical interest was
overlooked.</p>

<p>The question of prices in all these cases is involved in
equal uncertainty and difficulty. The second Psalter of
1459 brought at the Syston Park sale &pound;4950. Mr.
Quaritch still holds it (1897), and asks &pound;5250. The
British Museum possesses both impressions. This was
the highest figure ever reached by a single lot in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[<a href="./images/301.png">301</a>]</span>
country. Gutenberg's Bible follows, copies on vellum
and paper having produced from &pound;1500 to &pound;4000; the
vellum copies are deemed more valuable, but of those
issued by Gutenberg himself we seem to have only
examples on paper. The Huth copy of the latter type,
from the Sykes and H. Perkins libraries cost its late
owner &pound;3650. Mr. Grenville for his gave &pound;500. As we
have already remarked, the book has a tendency to
become commoner. The Ashburnham Fust and Schoeffer
Bible of 1462 brought &pound;1500; at the Comte de
Brienne's sale in 1724, where Hearne refers to the "vast
prices," the Earl of Oxford gave for the same book
&pound;112.</p>

<p>The <i>History of King Arthur</i>, printed by Caxton,
1485, for which Lord Jersey's ancestor gave &pound;2, 12s. 6d.
about 1750 to Osborne, was carried at the Osterley Park
sale in 1885 to &pound;1950, the British Museum underbidding;
while the <i>Troy-Book</i> in English from the same press
fetched &pound;1820; and at the dispersion of a curious lot of
miscellanies, apparently derived from Darlaston Hall, near
Stone, Staffordshire, an imperfect, but very large and
clean, copy of the first edition of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, by
Caxton, was adjudged to Mr. Quaritch at &pound;1020, a second
one, by an unparalleled coincidence presenting itself at
the same place of sale a few months later, only four leaves
wanting, but not so fine, and being knocked down at
&pound;1800 to the same buyer. The Asburnham Chaucers
and other works from the same press were (with one or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[<a href="./images/302.png">302</a>]</span>
two exceptions) so poor, that it was surprising that they
sold even so well as they did.</p>

<p>We descend to relatively moderate quotations when we
come to the Daniel (now Huth) Ballads in 1864 (&pound;750);
the &pound;670 and &pound;810 bidden for the Caxton's <i>Gower</i> at
the Selsey sale in 1871 and the Osterley Park sale in 1885
respectively; the &pound;600 paid for the <i>Book of St. Albans</i>,
1486, wanting two leaves, in 1882; and the &pound;420 at
which Mr. Quaritch estimated the <i>Troy-Book</i> of 1503.
The price asked for the original MS. of the <i>Towneley
Mysteries</i> in 1892, &pound;820, strikes one as reasonable by
comparison.</p>

<p>But amounts which we venture to think unduly extravagant
have of late years been obtained at Christies's
rooms for certain books, such as Lady Elizabeth Tirrwhyt's
<i>Prayers</i>, 1574, bound in gold, and said to have
belonged to Queen Elizabeth (1220 guineas);<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Henry
VIII.'s <i>Prayers</i>, 1544, printed on vellum,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and enriched
with notes by the King, the Queen, Prince Edward, and
Princess Mary (610 guineas, as above mentioned); and a
third folio Shakespeare, 1663-64, with both titles, but
represented as being almost unique in that state, &pound;435.
What a contrast to the old prices! Even in our time
and memory, the first folio could be had in fine state
for &pound;50 or &pound;60, the second for &pound;5, 5s., the third for
&pound;50, and the fourth for &pound;5, 5s. George Daniel, we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[<a href="./images/303.png">303</a>]</span>
informed by his representatives, gave about &pound;220 for his
first Shakespeare to William Pickering, and Mr. Corser
kept his 1632 book in his dining-room at Stand Rectory
among the commoner volumes, although it was a fine
copy. A middling set now fetches &pound;600 or thereabout.</p>

<p>The earlier standard both for English and foreign
rarities was undoubtedly much lower. In Osborne's
Catalogue for 1751, the <i>Toledo Missal</i>, described as the
scarcest volume in the world, was valued only at &pound;35.
In the Heber, and even in the Bright sale, from &pound;10 to
&pound;25 secured some of the greatest gems in ancient English
literature.</p>

<p>At the Frere auction at Sotheby's, 1896, however, the
realisation of the Fenn books beat every record, considering
that the copies were generally so poor; and it was
hard indeed to see where the value was in a Herbert's
Ames accompanied by an extra volume of typographical
fragments, of which many were mutilated and many were
worthless (&pound;255).</p>

<p>The <i>Book of St. Albans</i>, 1486, as it is usually designated,
has descended a little from its original rank as a first-class
rarity owing to the successive discovery of unknown
copies. The romance connected with the acquisition of the
Grenville one has been more than once printed; but the
<i>Chronicles of England</i>, from the same press, especially on
vellum, maintains its reputation for the utmost rarity,
although there were two impressions; and the same may
be said of the issues by William of Mecklin, Caxton, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[<a href="./images/304.png">304</a>]</span>
Gerard de Leeu, all and any of which could not, if complete,
fail to command very high prices even on paper.</p>

<p>&pound;4900 for the second edition of the Mainz Psalter,
1459, appears (as we have observed) to be the largest
sum ever paid in this country for a single work; and
the vellum copy of the Gutenberg Bible follows, &pound;900
behind; at least at the price of &pound;4000 it fell to Mr.
Quaritch at the Ashburnham sale in 1897. But for the
<i>Manesse Liederbuch</i>, a thirteenth-century MS. of national
ballads, carried away by the French from Heidelberg
in 1656, and found among the Ashburnham MSS., the
German Government practically paid in 1887 &pound;18,000.
What may be termed a bad second was the Duke of
Hamilton's Missal, sold to the German Government in
1887 for &pound;10,000; but that also belongs to the manuscript
class.</p>

<p>It must be an absolute truism to state that at the
present moment the American is a material factor in
influencing the book-market. He is less so, perhaps, in
the sort of way in which he assisted the booksellers of
a bygone generation in reducing or realising their stocks;
but he has come to the front more than ever as a competitor
for the prizes. There was a day when countless
Transatlantic libraries were in course of formation; but
they are now fairly complete, and, moreover, they have
the means at hand, not formerly available, of filling up
the gaps at home.</p>

<p>Our American kinsfolk have undoubtedly become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[<a href="./images/305.png">305</a>]</span>
masters of an almost countless number of bibliographical
gems, and have been content to pay handsomely for them.
We do not hear of any sensible reflux of old books from
the States, but that might happen hereafter under the
influence of financial depression. At the same time,
there is perhaps nothing on the other side of the
Atlantic which is not represented in duplicate here,
unless it be in an instance or two, as, for example, the
perfect Caxton <i>Morte Arthur</i>, 1485; and even those
volumes, which are of signal rarity, are almost without
exception in repositories accessible to all.</p>

<p>Returning for a moment to the commercial aspect of
our present topic, the Transatlantic acquirer at any cost
makes the fixture of high, even ridiculous, prices for
certain books impossible. Beyond the <i>maximum</i> there is
a higher <i>maximum</i> still. Who would have dreamed of a
first edition of Burns, although uncut, bringing, as it did
just lately (February 1898) in an Edinburgh auction-room,
&pound;572, or a sixpenny volume on Ploughs by one Small,
&pound;30, because it bore on the title, <i>Rob<sup>t</sup>. Burns, Poet</i>, in
the great man's own hand, as well as a holograph memorandum
attached to flyleaf? In the case of the Kilmarnock
Burns of 1786 the sole excuse of the purchaser was its
uncut state, for it is a comparatively common book. It
was acquired by Mr. Lamb of Dundee, a hotel-keeper, of
one Mr. Braidwood for &pound;60. A second copy in paper
covers, also uncut, exists; but the general condition is
not so good.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[<a href="./images/306.png">306</a>]</span>
There are in London and other English centres,
however, American export and commission agents, independently
of those houses which make shipments to
the States a collateral branch of their business. It has
been the cry, ever since we can recollect, that our
cousins were draining the old country of its books, and
yet the movement continues&mdash;continues with this difference,
that the Americans have now plenty of ordinary
stock, and are more anxious to limit their acquisitions to
rarities. The number of public and private libraries has
become very considerable; the most familiar names are
Lenox, Carter-Brown, Tower, and Pope, the last the
purchaser of the <i>King Arthur</i> printed by Caxton in 1485,
and formerly in the Harleian and Osterley Park collections.
There is an occasional reflux of exportations, and
we should like to hear one day of the <i>Arthur</i> being among
them.</p>

<p>One not very pleasant aspect of American and other
plutocratic competition has been to convert most of the
<i>capital</i> old English books from literature into <i>vertu</i>.
What else is it, when two imperfect Chaucers bring
&pound;2900, and a Walton's <i>Angler</i>, &pound;415, and where for
the second and third folio Shakespeares persons are found
willing to give a profit on &pound;500 or &pound;600?</p>

<p>The Transatlantic buyer, or indeed the buyer at a
distance anywhere, has no option in employing an agent
on the spot to acquire his <i>desiderata</i>, and he is practically
in his hands. So long as your representative is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[<a href="./images/307.png">307</a>]</span>
competent it is well enough, and on the whole the
American agencies in London are, we think, both that
and conscientious. But the frequenter of the salerooms
cannot fail to note a very unsatisfactory aspect of this
business by proxy, where an inexperienced amateur with
a well-lined purse employs an almost equally inexperienced
person to act on his behalf&mdash;that is to say, one who is a
bookseller by vocation, but who enjoys no conversance
with bibliographical niceties. His principal consequently
scores very poorly by buying <i>wrong</i> things at the <i>right</i>
prices; but if he is satisfied, who need be otherwise?
And his error, if his property is not realised in his lifetime,
never comes home to him! Nevertheless, to buy
with other people's eyes and judgment is not, after all,
the best form; all that can be pleaded for it is, that it
is the sole resource of the individual who has no time
to devote to the practical side, or who, if he has, distrusts
his own knowledge; and as everything has its compensation,
such are the customers on whom the trade
mainly leans. If the amateur expert were to be too
much multiplied, the professional bookseller would inevitably
be a grave sufferer.</p>

<p>Those are in the safest hands, perhaps, who are in
their own. But in the case of books, as of all analogous
property, the next best thing to acting for oneself is to
employ a high-class dealer, or, if the line is very special,
one who enjoys a reputation for conversance with the
particular branch of inquiry. Where a collector who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[<a href="./images/308.png">308</a>]</span>
does not possess personal knowledge, and takes into his
service a bookseller who is not much more informed, or
who has not studied certain classes of literature, it is
bound to be an exemplification of the blind leading the
blind, and one, at all events, unless he has a very long
purse, falling into the ditch.</p>

<p>Under any circumstances, it is unquestionably beneficial
to any private buyer to take some pains to arrive
at at least a general knowledge of values, as well as of
the bearings and extent of the field which he may choose.
He should not be a puppet in the hands of his representative,
if he can help it. Where he cannot, he is apt
to buy in one sort of market and to sell in another.
Not the worst policy is to hand a commission to one's
strongest opponent, if he will or can take it. It disarms
him. But some firms dislike agency, as the profit,
though sure, is often so narrow, particularly where the
person employed is a specialist in the line, and would
have given for purposes of re-sale in the ordinary way
twice or thrice as much as the item fetches, his personal
opposition withdrawn. Hence it is not unusual among
commission-agents at book-sales to charge, not on the
price realised, but on the figure given by the client. The
latter authorises his representative to bid up to &pound;10 for
this or that lot; it drops at &pound;2; the fee for buying it
is a percentage, not on the lower, but the higher amount.
A commission of &pound;6 was given by the present writer for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[<a href="./images/309.png">309</a>]</span>
a volume of John Leland's Tracts; it dropped at 2s.;
his agent charged him 10s. brokerage.</p>

<p>Some hand their orders direct to the auctioneer, and
this may be done within certain limits; but if the
practice becomes too habitual, the dealers retaliate by
bidding against the rostrum. "All is fair in love and
war."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> earliest method of communication between holders
and vendors of books and probable buyers of them related
to the issue of new works, or, at most, to such as were
not out of date. Maunsell's celebrated folio, of which he
was not apparently encouraged to proceed with more than
certain sections, and which did not comprise the subjects
most interesting to us, came out in 1595 in two parts,
and was, notwithstanding its imperfect fulfilment, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[<a href="./images/311.png">311</a>]</span>
most comprehensive enterprise of the kind in our language
down to comparatively recent times. These matters
usually took the form of notices, accompanying a published
volume, of others already in print or in preparation
by the same firm. No possessor or observer of old
English books can fail to have met with such advertisements;
but, as we have said, they limit themselves, as
a rule, to current literature and the ventures of the
immediate stationer or printer. To some copies of
Marmion's <i>Antiquary</i>, 1641, we find attached a slip
containing an announcement by Thomas Dring of old
plays on sale by him at the White Lion in Chancery
Lane, and inserted posterior to the issue of this particular
drama, which does not bear Dring's name; and we all
know the list of dramatic performances appended to
<i>Tom Tyler and his Wife</i>, 1661, and probably emanating
from Kirkman the bookseller, where we discern items
belonging to an earlier period&mdash;of some of which we know
nothing further. This catalogue, the material for which
Kirkman had personally brought together by the expenditure
of considerable time and labour, was re-issued
in 1671, and from about that time Clavell and other
members of the trade circulated periodical accounts of
all the novelties of the season, but almost entirely in
those classes which seem to have then appealed to the
public: Law, Science, and Divinity&mdash;just the sections
with which Maunsell in 1595 began and ended.</p>

<p>The absence of the machinery supplied by the auction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[<a href="./images/312.png">312</a>]</span>
long necessitated a practice which not only survived sales
by inch of candle and under the hammer, but which still
prevails, of disposing of libraries and small collections <i>en
bloc</i> to the trade, and the dedication by the particular
buyer of a serial catalogue to his purchase. Executors
and others long possessed no other means of realisation;
the Harleian printed books were thus dispersed; and
even those of Heber, almost within our own memory,
engrossed the resources of two or three firms of salesmen.
The conditions under which a library was accumulated in
former days were not less different than those under which
it passed into other hands; the possibilities of profit were
infinitesimal; a heavy loss was almost a certainty. But
then men bought more generally for the mere love of
the objects or for purposes of study. The speculative
element had yet to arise.</p>

<p>Evelyn, in his famous letter to Pepys, August 12,
1689, speaks of Lord Maitland's library as certainly the
noblest, most substantial, and accomplished, that ever
passed <i>under the spear</i>. This was within two decades
or so of the commencement of the system of selling
literary effects by auction. We are aware that in the
Bristol records of the fourteenth century the trumpet,
introduced from France, is mentioned as a medium for
the realisation of property in the same way; and there
was the much later <i>inch-of-candle</i> principle&mdash;a perhaps
unconscious loan from King Alfred's alleged time-candles,
which are referred to by his biographer Asser&mdash;a work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[<a href="./images/313.png">313</a>]</span>
suspected of being unauthentic, yet on that account may
have none the less suggested the idea to some one.</p>

<p>Abroad the <i>trumpet</i> or the <i>cry</i> appear among the
commercial states of the Middle Ages to have been the
usual forms. In the particulars of a sale of galleys by
auction at Venice in 1332,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the property was cried beforehand
on behalf of the Government, and the buyer, till
he paid the price reached, furnished a surety. This
process was known as the <i>incanto</i>; and it is curious
enough that in the sale-catalogue of Francis Hawes, Esq.,
a South Sea Company director, in 1722, the goods are
said to be on sale <i>by cant</i> or auction. But the modern
Italian still speaks of an auction as an <i>asta</i> (the Roman
<i>hasta</i>). Some of these types are illustrated by Lacroix
in his <i>M&oelig;urs et Usages</i>. In France they anciently had
the bell and the crier (the Roman <i>pr&aelig;co</i>).</p>

<p>In London, firms of commercial brokers long continued
to hold their sales of goods by inch of candle; but the
Roman practice seems to have survived down to comparatively
modern days in Spain and Portugal, if not
in France and Italy. In 1554, Junius Rabirius, a French
jurist, published at Paris, with a metrical inscription to
Henry II. of France, a Latin treatise on the origin of
<i>Hast&aelig; and Auctions</i>, in which he enters at some length
into the system pursued by the ancients, and still
retained in the sixteenth century by the Latin communities
of Europe. This is probably the earliest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>[<a href="./images/314.png">314</a>]</span>
monograph which we possess on the present branch of
the subject. It is a tolerably dull and uninforming one.</p>

<p>Some of us are aware by practical experience how
deplorably tedious a normal modern auction under the
hammer is, although it extends only at the utmost from
one to five or six in the afternoon. But, like some of the
Continental sales of to-day, the old-fashioned affair spread,
with a break for refreshment, over twice the space of time,
and was conducted, previous to the introduction of the
hammer, by <i>inch of candle</i>. This system was somewhat
less inconvenient than it at first sight strikes us as being,
since the property was lotted to a much larger extent in
parcels and bundles, and the biddings were apt to be
comparatively fewer. Another way of saying that the
early auction appealed less to private than to professional
buyers, and not merely in that, but in every aspect. The
same remark still applies to the dispersion of all miscellaneous
collections of secondary importance, unless an
amateur chooses to compete for a dozen articles, which
he does not want, for the sake of one, which he does.</p>

<p>The steadily accumulating volume of literary production
in the seventeenth century inspired two successive
movements, which we regard to-day as peremptory
necessities and matters of course, but which, so long as
books were scarcer, and the demand for them correspondingly
restricted, failed to strike any one as likely
to prove popular and advantageous. These movements
were the second-hand department and the auction-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[<a href="./images/315.png">315</a>]</span>room.
It is a sufficiently familiar fact that during the
reign of Charles II. both sprang into existence, although
among the Hollanders the usage of putting up books to
public competition had commenced three-quarters of a
century prior; but in 1661 there do not appear to
have been any facilities for disposing of libraries or collections,
as in that year John Ogilby, the historian,
arranged to sell his books&mdash;the remainder of his own
publications&mdash;through the medium of a lottery. It was
within a very brief interval, however, that the sale by
auction is shown to have become an accomplished fact.
The earliest of which an actual catalogue has come down
to us is that of Dr. Lazarus Seaman, sold by Cooper
in 1676; but there were in all probability anterior experiments,
and side by side with the auctioneer grew
up the professional ancestor of the Thorpes and the
Rodds&mdash;the men who supplied Burton, Drummond,
Evelyn, Pepys, Selden, and many more, with the
rarities which are yet associated with their names.
The system of selling under the hammer in its various
stages of development and different ramifications is not
an unimportant factor in our modern social and commercial
life; it did not require many years from its
introduction into the metropolis to recommend it to
the provinces and to Scotland; and we possess catalogues
of libraries or properties dispersed in this manner at
Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh,
and elsewhere in the last quarter of the last but one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[<a href="./images/316.png">316</a>]</span>
century; and in one case at least of this kind of property
being offered at a fair.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Occasionally, as in the
case of Secondary Smith, 1682, a precocious feeling for
the early English school reveals itself; but, for the
most part, the articles accentuated by the old-fashioned
auctioneer are foreign classics, history, and theology&mdash;the
literary wares, in fact, in vogue. Annexed to the
<i>Memoirs of Thomas</i> (or <i>Tom</i>) <i>Brown</i>, 1704, is a very
unusual feature&mdash;a catalogue of his library.</p>

<p>Within about five-and-twenty years of the supposed
starting-point of the auction, the modern practice of
the London auctioneer being engaged to conduct sales
in the country, even in important provincial towns,
seems to have fairly commenced, for in 1700 Edward
Millington of Little Britain sold at Cambridge the
library of Dr. Cornwall of Clapton in Northamptonshire.
In the preliminary matter attached to the catalogue,
Millington remarks that "he always esteems it a
privilege to exercise his lungs amongst his friends."</p>

<p>A glimpse of the method of collecting by the Hon.
John North, one of the sons of Lord North of Kirtling,
and born in 1645, is afforded by his brother and
biographer, Roger North, who says that he gradually
accumulated, commencing about 1666, a large collection
of books, principally Greek, and generally bought them
himself, spending much time in company with his relation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[<a href="./images/317.png">317</a>]</span>
in booksellers' shops, and not objecting to possess duplicates,
if other copies in better condition were found or
were presented to him by friends. Mr. North flourished
during the halcyon days of the classics. The literature
of his own country probably interested him little. North,
however, was so far a true book-lover, inasmuch as he
sought what pleased himself.</p>

<p>It affords a pleasanter impression of the pursuit when
one perceives individuals of all ranks and callings buying
themselves personally, either at the book-shop or the
saleroom, in the selection of their periodical acquisitions.
The marked copies of the older auction catalogues are
distinguished by the names of some of our most eminent
collectors, but at present gentlemen prefer to give their
commissions to their booksellers from want of leisure or
other motives.</p>

<p>I have alluded to the sale by auction of Dr. Seaman's
library in 1676, which took place at his house in Warwick
Court, Warwick Lane. The address to the reader,
presumably by Cooper, commences:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It hath not been usual here in England to make sale of Books
by way of Auction, or who will give most for them: But it having
been practised in other Countreys to the Advantage both of Buyers
and Sellers; It was therefore conceived (for the Encouragement of
Learning) to publish the Sale of these Books this manner of way."
The Catalogue is not divided into days, but the fifth condition says,
"That the Auction will begin the 31st of October, punctually at
Nine of the Clock in the Morning, and Two in the afternoon, and
this to continue daily until all the Books be Sold; Wherefore it is
desired, that the Gentlemen, or those deputed by them, may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[<a href="./images/318.png">318</a>]</span>
there precisely the Hours appointed, lest they should miss the
opportunity of Buying those Books, which either themselves or
their Friends desire."</p></div>

<p>In 1682 Thomas Parkhurst, in offering for sale the
libraries of several eminent men, announces that the
catalogues might be had <i>gratis</i> at the Bible on London
Bridge (his place of business as a bookseller), and he
takes occasion to introduce (perhaps for the first time)
that courageous form of statement so popular to this
day among the fraternity as to the collection being the
finest ever sold or to be sold, and the opportunity by
consequence being one which would never probably recur.</p>

<p>But the present writer does not enter minutely into
this branch of the subject, which Mr. Lawler has made
his own.</p>

<p>It has always been, and must always remain, a
mystery whence the Harleian exemplars of a large
number of unique or almost unique volumes belonging
to the early vernacular literature of Great Britain
were obtained. In some cases they are traceable to
anterior owners and catalogues; but a considerable residue
first come to the front here, and the explanation
seems to be that the practice of registering unregarded
trifles, as they were then deemed to be, in large parcels
was necessarily fatal to individuality and to the survival
of clues. To a certain extent the same disappointment
awaits us in more recent days, till, in fact, the demand
for old poetry, romances, and plays made the few extant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[<a href="./images/319.png">319</a>]</span>
copies objects of interest to the trade sufficient to entitle
them to prominence in their lists and in those published
by the auctioneers. It may have been the catalogue of
Joseph Ames, 1760, which was among the earliest to
raise such items to the dignity of separate lots, thought
by the purchasers at the time worth a shilling or two;
but the noted sale of Mr. West in 1773 is entitled to
rank as the foremost in those days, where the books and
tracts, long since discovered to be represented by one
or two accidental survivors, and grown dearer than gold
a hundredfold, began to draw figures indicative of increased
curiosity and appreciation.</p>

<p>The most eminent of the earlier race of auctioneers
in London, who confined their attention to properties
belonging to the fine arts, were William Cooper, a man
of considerable literary taste and culture, whom we have
seen disposing of Dr. Seaman's books in 1676; Edward
Millington, Robert Scott, and John Dunton, of whom
we know more than of his predecessors and contemporaries
through his publications, and especially his <i>Life and
Errors</i>. Commercial rivalry and jealousy arose among
the members of the fraternity before the institution had
grown at all old, and complaints were also made against
gentlemen-bidders. In the preface to the catalogue of a
French library, where he takes occasion to animadvert
severely on his contemporary and confr&egrave;re Scott, Millington
refers to the third condition of sale, requiring
all buyers to give in their place of abode, "to prevent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[<a href="./images/320.png">320</a>]</span>
the inconveniences that have more or less hitherto
attended the Undertakers, and also the Purchasers, by
reason that several persons, out of Vanity and Ostentation,
have appeared and bought, to the damage and
disappointment of the Parties they outbid, and have
not been so kind to their own Reputation, or just to
the Proprietors, as to pay for and fetch them away."
This was in 1687.</p>

<p>It seems to have been a considerable time after the
first institution of the auction before a fixed place of
business was appointed for the sale of literary and artistic
properties consigned to a particular party for realisation.
We find taverns and coffee-houses much in request for this
purpose during the former half of the last century.
The library of printed books and MSS. belonging to
Thomas Britton, "small-coal man," were sold about
1720 at Tom's Coffee-House, and about the same date
portions of Thomas Rawlinson's stupendous collections,
of which the dispersion extended over a dozen years,
came to the hammer at the Paul's Head Tavern in
Carter Lane.</p>

<p>It is improbable that any early auction catalogue of
consequence has disappeared, and looking at those which
we have, say, from the outset to 1700, we at once perceive
the comparatively limited business transacted in
this direction during a lengthened term of years, and the
numerous instances where a not very considerable catalogue
embraces three or four properties. Collections<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[<a href="./images/321.png">321</a>]</span>
were, as a rule, made on a smaller scale prior to the
Harley epoch.</p>

<p>The practice of publishing booksellers' and auctioneers'
catalogues, rudimentary as it was at the outset, succeeded
by the more systematic descriptive accounts of public and
private collections, gradually extended the knowledge of
the surviving volumes of early literature, and laid the
foundation of a National Bibliography. We shall probably
never fully learn our amount of obliged indebtedness
to Richard Heber, who in his own person, from
about 1800 to 1833, consolidated and concentrated an
immense preponderance of the acquisitions of anterior
collectors, and with them gained innumerable treasures,
which came to him through other channels. His marvellous
catalogue must have proved a revelation at the
time, and to-day it is a work of reference at once instructive
and agreeable.</p>

<p>What must strike any one who has attentively considered
the Heber library, even if it is not a case of
having had the catalogue at his elbow, as I have, in a
manner, all his life, is the presence there of so large a
number of items of which no trace occurs in earlier lists,
and of which no duplicates have since presented themselves.
It is perfectly marvellous how Heber accumulated
the vast bibliographical treasures brought to light, and
of which his catalogue is the record achievement; he
must have been not only indefatigable in his own person,
but must have furnished encouragement to many others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[<a href="./images/322.png">322</a>]</span>
who met with rare books, to afford him the first refusal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, hundreds of early English books
and tracts which this indefatigable and munificent of collectors
never succeeded in obtaining, items and authors
whose titles and names were hitherto utterly unknown,
have within the last two generations come piecemeal
into the market, to delight alike, yet in a different way,
the bibliographer and the amateur. The accidental and
almost miraculous survival of literary relics of past
ages is curious on account of the purely casual manner
in which they present themselves from season to season,
as well as from the strange hands in which many of
them are found&mdash;often persons of obscure character and
in humble life, who have one, two, or half-a-dozen books
of which all had somehow eluded the researches of every
collector. Cases are known in which a single article
has come to light in this manner, a unique publication
of the Plantagenet or Tudor era, maybe in sorry state,
maybe just as it left the press two or three centuries
ago, but anyhow a monument and a revelation.</p>

<p>The almost exclusive sources of intelligence on these
questions are the correspondence of the period, a portion
of which is printed in the volumes of 1813 devoted to
Aubrey's Collections, and another in Nichols's <i>Anecdotes</i>.
There we perceive that Lord Oxford was indebted for
many rarities to John Bagford and other private purveyors
of printed books as well as MSS. In a letter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[<a href="./images/323.png">323</a>]</span>
1731 to Hearne, his Lordship mentions his impression that
he had forty-two Caxtons at that date. He seems to have
possessed seventy-three examples of Wynkyn de Worde.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>With respect to some of the college libraries at
Oxford, Cambridge, and even Dublin, it is easier to
arrive at the facts, so far as they go, or, in other words,
many of the rare and important acquisitions of those
institutions came to them at a period anterior to what
may be termed the bibliographical era, and were often
contemporary gifts from the authors of the volumes or
from early owners of them.</p>

<p>The value of the auction became manifest at a comparatively
early date, when a clear demand for certain
descriptions of literary property had set in, particularly
when the formation of the Harleian library was in progress.
In 1757 the representatives of Sir Julius C&aelig;sar,
Master of the Rolls under James I., proposed to sell his
MSS., and eventually negotiated with a cheesemonger,
who offered &pound;10 for the collection as waste paper.
Paterson, the auctioneer, fortunately heard of the affair,
dissuaded the family from it, and prepared a careful
catalogue of the articles, by which he realised to the
owners &pound;356. Take another case. In 1856 the Wolfrestons
decided on parting with a lot of old books and
pamphlets which an ancestor had collected under the
Stuarts, or even earlier, and would, as one of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>[<a href="./images/324.png">324</a>]</span>
informed us, have gladly accepted &pound;30 for the whole.
But they were sent to Sotheby's, and realised &pound;750.</p>

<p>On the other hand, instances are by no means unknown,
in spite of what the auctioneers may assert, where
it has suited a bookseller to give for a library or a parcel
of books a sum at all events sufficient to tempt the
owner, who has always before his eyes, in the case of a
sale under the hammer, a variety of risks and draw-backs,
which an immediate cheque, even for a lower
amount, at once removes.</p>

<p>After all, the book-lover must, as a rule, be satisfied
with the pleasure attendant on temporary possession.</p>

<p>Of the houses which lend themselves in our own day,
and have done so during the last hundred or hundred
and fifty years, to the incessant redistribution of literary
acquisitions, and have gradually reduced an originally
rather rudimentary principle to a sort of fine art, so
much has been written by a succession of gentlemen
interested in these specialities that we could hardly
add much that was new, or treat this aspect of the
topic without repeating others or ourselves.</p>

<p>A point which merits a passing mention, however,
is the history of the bidding at these scenes of competition.
It has been remarked as a singular circumstance
that in the seventeenth century penny biddings were
usual; but it was the silver penny of those days, and
we have to remember the higher purchasing value of
money. Twopenny and threepenny advances succeeded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>[<a href="./images/325.png">325</a>]</span>
and although these have long ceased in London, they
yet survive in the provinces, where the lots are less
important. Some of the principal houses now decline
even sixpence, a shilling being the <i>minimum</i> offer entertained.
The twopenny bidding still prevailed in 1731,
as a priced copy of the sale catalogue of Robert Gray,
M.D.,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> shows. An offer of threepence is still not unknown
in the provinces, as we have intimated above in our
notice of an episode in Lincolnshire&mdash;not the Spalding
one, but a second about the same point of time.</p>

<p>One of the not least interesting and curious aspects
of the auction system is the diversity of motives inducing
owners to part with their property. A study of the
title-pages or covers of catalogues admits us ostensibly
to the confidence of this or that collector. We should
not otherwise become aware that some fairly obscure
gentleman or lady was leaving his or her actual abode,
that Balbus was changing the character of his library,
that his friend so-and-so, owing to a failure of health,
had found it necessary to settle in a more genial climate,
or that "a well-known amateur," of whom we never
heard before, was selling his duplicates. What does it
signify? Literary acquisitions, in common with everything
else, are constantly passing from one hand to
another. Of course, if the last proprietor is deceased,
if it is an executor's affair, it is just as well to mention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[<a href="./images/326.png">326</a>]</span>
the fact, as it places the operation on a clearer footing,
and there is little, if any, suspicion of nursing; but with
ordinary lots of books, where the party or parties interested
may be living, it seems preferable to describe
the objects of competition purely and simply as so many
items for sale. The reason for the step is immaterial,
more especially as there is a proneness to receive the one
tendered, if not with indifference, with incredulity.</p>

<p>A singular entry in one of the sale catalogues of
Edward Jeffery, of Warwick Street, Golden Square,
under 1788, is a property described as "the <i>lounging</i>
books of a gentleman," in the near vicinity of which we
come across "the Parliamentary and constitutional library
of a man of fashion."</p>

<p>Of course, where a famous or capital assemblage of
literary treasures is for sale, it is quite proper and
expedient on every account to connect with it the name
on which it confers, and which may even confer on it,
distinction. But it is different when Mr. Jones is changing
his lines, or Mr. Brown is removing into the country
or out of it, or the executors of the late Mr. Robinson
have given instructions for the submission of his effects
to the hammer. <i>Qu'importe?</i> Who cares?</p>

<p>The composition of an average auction-room, where
the property is miscellaneous, is a curious and not unedifying
study. One beholds a large, closely-packed
room, where the atmosphere is not too salubrious, and
yet the names which the auctioneer proclaims as those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[<a href="./images/327.png">327</a>]</span>
of the buyers are not numerous, are not even in all
cases the names of persons present. The reason is that
booksellers or their representatives often attend sales for
the sake of watching the market or of noting the prices,
and are on the spot when a lot occurs which suits them,
or for which they have a commission. It is not perhaps
too much to say that if the company should be reduced
by 75 per cent. the quotations would remain unaltered,
for a certain proportion are dummies beyond a moderate
figure, and a certain proportion never open their mouths.
The latter are spectators, or proprietors, or individuals
whose biddings are given from the rostrum by proxy.
An experienced dealer will probably guess for whom the
salesman or his clerk is acting, and will be guided by
such a hint in his own course of proceeding.</p>

<p>Where the goods on sale are of a prevailingly low
standard, the scene varies in compliance with the circumstances,
and the purchasers' names in the priced
catalogue are almost without exception the names of
booksellers, who make their account by going in for
heavy lots and rough stuff&mdash;an excellent vocation thirty
years ago, but now a fairly forlorn hope and quest.
The bargain is no longer to the man who can buy for
a shilling and sell for a pound, but to him who has
the courage and means to buy for fifty pounds what he
can sell for five times fifty by virtue of his knowledge
and connection.</p>

<p>To watch carefully and studiously a big sale such as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>[<a href="./images/328.png">328</a>]</span>
that of the Ashburnham library, of which two out of
three portions are now scattered, is a bibliographical, if
not a commercial, education in little. We attended in
person throughout, and observed with interest and profit
the curious working, unappreciable to those not practically
versed in books, and acquainted with the result only
through paragraphs in the newspapers. A spectator
with some preparatory training could see how and why
certain lots fetched such and such abnormal figures; and
a leading agency in this direction was the unfortunate
employment&mdash;unfortunate for himself, not for the owner
or the auctioneer&mdash;by a leading buyer of an agent who
had to win his purchases from men stronger than himself.
Thus the Caxton's <i>Jason</i>, instead of bringing
perhaps &pound;1000, ran up to more than twice that sum,
while, if it was re-sold under different conditions, it might
not even reach the lower amount. Still more striking
were the offers for such things as the first English edition
of More's <i>Utopia</i> (&pound;51), a volume which has repeatedly
sold for a couple of guineas; while, on the other hand,
a handsomely bound copy of Bourrienne's <i>Memoires</i> in
ten volumes went for 11s., and other ordinary works in
proportion.</p>

<p>The names in the booksellers' ledgers and in the
auctioneers' catalogues as buyers of old or scarce literature
are not by any means necessarily always the names of
collectors. They are often those of middlemen, through
whose hands a volume passes before it reaches its ultimate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[<a href="./images/329.png">329</a>]</span>
destination&mdash;passes in many cases from one of these
channels to another. This is, of course, another mode
of saying that the number of actual book-holders on their
own permanent account is comparatively limited, and so
it is. A call on the part of two or three persons for a
particular class of work or subject immediately puts the
whole trade on its mettle; everything directly or indirectly
connected with the new topic is bought up or
competed for with extraordinary and abrupt eagerness;
the entire fraternity is bent on supplying the latest
demand; and prices rise with proportionate rapidity to
an extravagant height. The market consists of a couple
or trio of individuals, who might be insensible to the
excitement which they have occasioned if it were not for
the offers from all sides which pour in upon them from
day to day; and in a season or so it is all over; quotations
are as before; and the running is on something
different. Books of Emblems, Catholic Literature,
Gardening and Agriculture, Occult Sciences, Early
Poetry, Old Plays, Americana, Bewick, Cruikshank, the
modern novelists, have all had their day. But the cry
and the want are largely artificial. The customers are
few; the caterers are many. Such a criticism applies
only to the rarer and costlier <i>desiderata</i>.</p>

<p>The characteristics and frequent surprises of auction
figures largely proceed from the pressure brought to bear
from without by bidders who are in the background,
who often possess slight bibliographical knowledge, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[<a href="./images/330.png">330</a>]</span>
whose resources enable them to furnish their representatives
with generous instructions. These competitors are
usually restricted to prominent sales, where the capital
items are numerous, and the name of the proprietor is
that of a departed celebrity, or at all events, where
certain copies, whether of manuscripts or printed books,
are submitted to public competition after a lengthened
period of detention in the hands of the late holder. The
Ashburnham sale (now completed) afforded abundant
proof of the influence on the market of a collector who
began to form his library before many of us were born,
and who succeeded not only in securing many treasures
at present almost beyond reach, but in doing so at fairly
moderate prices. But even when the late Lord Ashburnham
went to what was in his time considered an extreme
figure, he or his estate generally gained. For example,
his <i>Parzival and Titurell</i>, 1477, which cost Mr. Quaritch
&pound;30, and was sold to his Lordship for &pound;45 or less (Lord
Ashburnham did not object to a discount), was reacquired
by the former for &pound;81, and the set of Walton's <i>Angler</i>,
which is understood to have cost &pound;200, realised four
times that amount.</p>

<p>The auction mart, where literary property of all kinds
changes hands, possesses its slang vocabulary, and knows
alike the <i>Frost</i> and the <i>Boom</i>&mdash;not to mention the <i>Fluke</i>.
In the notices which occur in the press the public sees
only one side, only the high quotations. The public are
of course, as a rule, destitute of bibliographical know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>[<a href="./images/331.png">331</a>]</span>ledge,
and so is the normal journalist. He marches into
the room after some sale, asks for the priced catalogue,
scans the pages, and makes notes of the highest figures,
which are as often as not misprinted by him in the organ
by which he is employed. He does not say that a lot
which was worth &pound;20 went for &pound;2, or that one which
would usually fetch &pound;2, brought &pound;20 by reason of some
mentioned technicality, because he does not know. A
man who has devoted his life to the study of books and
prices is aware that there are occasions when very
ordinary property realises silly prices, and that there are
others when the rarest and most valuable articles are
given away. Sometimes, again, the company is not
<i>unanimous</i> enough, and a sovereign's worth may go for
more than a sovereign, or, if there is perfect friendship
among those present, a first folio Shakespeare may drop
at a dozen pounds; but then there is, you know, <i>the court
of appeal</i>, which reassesses the amount to be finally paid.
Not invariably. We have our very selves not so long
since, on a hot Saturday afternoon, sat at the auctioneer's
table, and made nearly a clean sweep of a library of old
English plays, where the maximum bid was eighteen
pence, and there was a buzz through the room when one,
no better than the rest, was accidentally carried to 14s.</p>

<p>But to the artificial inflation of prices in our salerooms
there is more than one side and one key. There
was not so long since an instance at Christie's, and a
second at Sotheby's, where the high quotations were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>[<a href="./images/332.png">332</a>]</span>
entirely due to the competition of a so-called interloper,
who bade, as he thought, on the judgment of the room,
and was signally handicapped. Again, something has
ere now been carried to a prodigious figure owing to an
unlimited commission inadvertently given to two agents.
The old Duke of Wellington once gave &pound;105 in this way
for a shilling pamphlet, and even then the bidding was
only stopped by arrangement. However, of all the
miraculous surprises, the most signal on record was
one of the most recent&mdash;the Frere sale at Sotheby's in
1896, already alluded to, where the prices realised for
books in very secondary preservation set all records and
precedents at thorough defiance. The phenomenon, if it
could be referred to any cause, arose from the peculiar
atmosphere and surroundings; it was a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> old
library, formed partly by the Freres of Roydon Hall,
Norfolk, and partly by their relative Sir John Fenn,
editor of the <i>Paston Letters</i>, and a rather noted antiquary
of the eighteenth century. It was all straight and fair, so
far as one could see; there was no "rigging," and the
competition was simply insane. A portion of the Paston
Correspondence struck us as cheap by comparison at
&pound;400; it was that which was offered at Christie's some
time since, and bought in at about the same figure.</p>

<p>There were one or two singular errors in the catalogue.
An Elizabethan edition of Sir John Mandeville's Travels
was ascribed to 1503 and the press of Wynkyn de Worde,
and the Tylney Psalter, belonging to the fifteenth century,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>[<a href="./images/333.png">333</a>]</span>
was stated in a note by a former possessor to be of the
age of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion. One of the most unaccountable
blunders in an auctioneer's catalogue which
we can call to mind was the description of a Sarum
service book as a grammatical treatise. But solecisms
of various kinds are periodical. A German book is said
to be printed at Gedruckt, and a copy of Sir John
Mandeville in Italian is entered as <i>Questo</i>, that being its
compiler's frugal method of giving the title (<i>Questo e il
libro</i>).</p>

<p>One striking feature in the Frere sale was that it was
only a part of the library, and that not the part which
the auctioneers' representative saw at Roydon. Some
further instalments occurred at another saleroom a few
months later; and perhaps there is yet more to come.
But in a bibliographical respect the dispersion proved of
interest, as many of the items, formerly Sir John Fenn's,
had remained imperfectly known and described; and it
was not absolutely certain that they survived.</p>

<p>An element in the modern auctions which is patent
to all fairly conversant with such <i>mysteria</i>, and has
become one not less indispensable than normal, is what
is commonly known as the <i>Rig</i>. A Rig is a sale which
departs or declines from the strict line of <i>bona fides</i> so far
as not to be precisely what the forefront of the catalogue
avouches it, and by one or two houses it is discountenanced.
Nevertheless it exists, and will continue from
the nature of things to do so; and we observe in the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>[<a href="./images/334.png">334</a>]</span>
opening decade of auctions, in the very infancy of the
system, a trace or germ of this commencing impurity or
abuse. For some of the catalogues, so far back as 1678,
purport to register within their covers the libraries of
certain noblemen or gentleman "and others" (<i>aliorumque</i>,
in the Latin diction then so much in favour), and so it
has been ever since. When we go to the rooms and lift
up our voices, we do not always know whose property we
are trying to secure; nor, if our own judgment is worth
anything, does it greatly signify.</p>

<p>P. 5. Of the public collections in England, those of Humphrey, Duke
of Gloucester, at Oxford, of which very little remains, and of Sir
John Gyllarde, Prior of the Calendaries' Gild in Bristol (founded
before 1451), appear to be the pioneers. For the latter the Bishop of
Worcester is said to have provided, in 1464, a receptacle or building;
but the collection was destroyed by fire in 1466.</p>

<p>P. 5. <i>Illuminated MSS.</i>&mdash;A great store of information is capable of
being collected on the subject of the embellishing and finishing
processes which MSS. underwent when the scribe had done his
part. Among the Paston Letters occurs a bill from Thomas (the)
Limner of Bury St. Edmunds to Sir John Howard, afterward Duke
of Norfolk, in 1467, for illuminating several books, and we have also
one of Antoine Verard of Paris, "Enlumineur du Roy," in 1493 for
similar work executed for the Comte d'Angoul&ecirc;me by artists in the
printer's employment.</p>

<p>P. 7. <i>Circulating Libraries.</i>&mdash;There was a library of this class at
Dunfermline in 1711 and at Edinburgh in 1725. When Benjamin
Franklin came to London, there was nothing of the kind. A bookseller
named Wright established one about 1740, and it was kept up
by his successors. Sion College was limited in its lending range to
the London clergy.</p>

<p>P. 9. Add the Le Stranges of Hunstanton to the East Anglian
collectors.</p>

<p>P. 9. <i>Kent as a Hunting-ground for Books in Old Days.</i>&mdash;Flockton
of Canterbury it was who once sold Marlowe's <i>Dido</i>, 1594, for 2s. He
was a contemporary of William Hutton, the Birmingham bookseller.
This may have been the very copy which formerly belonged to
Henry Oxinden of Barham, near Canterbury, and passed in succession
into the hands of Isaac Reed, George Steevens, the Duke of Roxburghe,
Sir Egerton Brydges, and Mr. Heber. The price charged by
Flockton, however, was fairly extravagant in comparison with that
given by John Henderson, the actor, for the copy which subsequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[<a href="./images/336.png">336</a>]</span>
belonged to J. P. Kemble and the Duke of Devonshire&mdash;fourpence&mdash;probably
the original published price.</p>

<p>P. 10. <i>Bristol Houses.</i>&mdash;Add <i>Strong</i>. Strong's catalogues for 1827-1828
are now before me, and describe 10,000 items. No such stock has
been kept at Bristol since. Jefferies had in former days some very
remarkable books on sale&mdash;Caxtons included; and Kerslake and
George could shew you volumes worth your notice and money, whoever
you might be. Now, alas! you have to leave the city as empty
as you entered it.</p>

<p>P. 18. <i>Loss of Old Books.</i>&mdash;The fate of a heavy percentage of our
earlier books&mdash;of the earlier books of every people&mdash;is curiously and
mournfully readable in the illiterate bucolic scrawls, doing duty for
autographs and inscriptions, which tell, only too plainly, how such
property slowly but surely passed out of sight and existence.</p>

<p>P. 19. <i>Old Libraries.</i>&mdash;Add Fraser of Lovat, Boswell of Auchinleck,
and Fountaine of Narford.</p>

<p>P. 25. <i>Rolls of Book-Collectors.</i>&mdash;Rather say 5000 names.</p>

<p>P. 29. <i>Spoliation of Libraries.</i>&mdash;A precious volume of early English
tracts was not very long since offered at an auction, which had been
stolen from Peterborough Cathedral, and another, which constituted
one of the chief treasures of Sion College.</p>

<p>P. 32. The bulk of the books of Mr. Samuel Sandars were left to
the University Library, Cambridge, which has since acquired those
of the late Lord Acton.</p>

<p>P. 33. <i>Lincoln Cathedral Library.</i>&mdash;Besides the Honeywood books
sold to Dibdin, the Dean and Chapter have suffered others to stray
from their homes. A notice is before me of one, a large folio on
vellum, containing tracts of a theological complexion, chiefly by an
Oxford doctor, Robert of Leicester, which was presented, as a coeval
inscription apprises us, by Thomas Driffield, formerly Chancellor of
the Diocese, in 1422 to the new library of the cathedral.</p>

<p>P. 34. <i>Provincial Libraries.</i>&mdash;Of the books at Bamborough Castle,
a catalogue was printed at Durham in 1799. Some of the books at
York Minster appear to have been gifts from Archbishop Mathews.
At Colchester they are fortunate in possessing the library of Archbishop
Harsnet.</p>

<p>P. 35. Marlowe's <i>Edward II.</i>, 1594.&mdash;Possibly obtained by the
Landgraf of Hesse during his visit to London in 1611. This is mentioned
by me in my <i>Shakespear Monograph</i>, 1903.</p>

<p>P. 37. <i>Private Libraries.</i>&mdash;In the case of private collections, we
have to distinguish between those of an ancestral character, insensibly
accumulated from generation to generation without any fixed or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>[<a href="./images/337.png">337</a>]</span>
preconcerted plan, and such as have been formed by or for wealthy
individuals in the course of a single life, if not of a few years, on some
general principle, with or without an eye to cost. Under either of
these conditions the motive is usually personal, and the ultimate transfer
in some instances to a public institution an accident or afterthought.</p>

<p>P. 38. <i>Harleian Library.</i>&mdash;The taste of the Harley family for books
dated from the time of Charles I. Sir Robert Harley, of Brampton
Castle, is credited with the possession of "an extraordinary library
of manuscript and printed books, which had been collected from one
descent to another." The house was besieged and burned in 1643,
and these literary and bibliographical treasures probably perished
with it. But his grandson, the first Earl of Oxford, restored the
library; and we all know that the second earl, who survived till 1741,
elevated it to the rank of the first private collection in England,
while he unconsciously sacrificed it to the incidence of a languid and
falling market.</p>

<p>P. 42. Mr. William Henry Miller of Craigentinny was originally a
solicitor in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>P. 65. <i>Books of Emblems.</i>&mdash;Besides those described is the translation
executed by Thomas Combe, and licensed in 1593, of the
<i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Bons Engins</i> of Guillaume de la Perriere, of which no
perfect copy of any edition had been seen till the writer met with
one of 1614 among the Burton-Constable books.</p>

<p>P. 103. <i>Books Appreciable on Special Grounds.</i>&mdash;Among these are&mdash;Pennant's
<i>Tour in Scotland</i>, 1769, and White's <i>Selborne</i>, 1785.
Everybody is aware that there are better works on Scotland than
Pennant's, and better accounts of birds, those of Selborne included,
than White's. But we desire the two heirlooms, as their authors left
them, pure and simple. We prefer not to have to disentangle the two
pieces of eighteenth century workmanship from the editorial and
artistic improvements which have overlaid them. A much-edited
writer becomes a partner in a limited company without a vote. His
pages are converted by degrees into an arena where others commend
him above his deserts, or what might have been his wishes, while
here and there he finds a commentator, whose aim is to convince you
how superior a job he would have made of it had it been left to him.</p>

<p>P. 109. <i>Translations.</i>&mdash;It is remarkable that Aulus Gellius makes
the same complaint as is embodied in the text, about the lame
versions of Latin writers from the Greek.</p>

<p>P. 117. Howell's <i>New Sonnets and Pretty Pamphlets</i>.&mdash;The Huth
fragment seems as if it would complete the unique, but imperfect,
Capell copy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>[<a href="./images/338.png">338</a>]</span>
P. 119. <i>A Hundred Merry Tales.</i>&mdash;Besides the Huth mutilated
copy and the G&ouml;ttingen complete one (of 1526) there is a fragment at
the Birthplace Museum, Stratford. I saw it there, but did not note
to what impression it belonged.</p>

<p>P. 122. <i>Four Sons of Aymon</i>, 1504.&mdash;A fine copy is offered at 15s.
in a catalogue about 1760. Of the <i>Famous history of the vertuous
and godly woman Judith</i>, 1565, all that is so far discoverable is that
it is a translation in English metre by Edward Jenynges. A title-page,
preserved among Ames's collections at the British Museum, is
copied by me in <i>Bibl. Coll.</i>, 1903, pp. 210-11.</p>

<p>P. 125. <i>Destruction of Books.</i>&mdash;Untold numbers of volumes have
also been sacrificed to the accumulation of material on special lines.
Tons of the <i>Annual Register</i>, <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, and the like, have been lost, if it be a loss, in this way. A
few pages, maybe, are all that survive of a book, and when the
library of the specialist is sold, the rest shares the same fate at the
hands of an unsympathetic purchaser.</p>

<p>P. 126. <i>Unique copies.</i>&mdash;The play of <i>Orestes</i>, 1567, came to light at
Plymouth about forty years ago with an equally unique issue of one
of Drayton's pieces. Of such things the present writer has met in
the course of a lengthened career with treasures which would make a
small library, and has beheld no duplicates.</p>

<p>P. 128. <i>Fragments.</i>&mdash;The Fragment has within the last twenty or
thirty years come into surprising evidence, and in my latest instalment
of <i>Bibliographical Notes</i>, 1903, I have been enabled to supply numerous
deficiencies in existing records even of modern date from a variety of
sources not ostensibly connected with Bagford, Fenn, or any other
culprit of this type, shewing that the process of disappearance was in
universal operation, and that mere chance arrested it here and there
just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>P. 128. <i>Capital Books.</i>&mdash;It is perhaps not unfair to add that although
Milton's <i>Poems</i>, 1645, is not a rare book, it is eminently so in an irreproachable
state, to say nothing of such a copy as the Bodleian one
presented by the poet himself, which one of the earlier officials, a Dr.
Hudson, thought might be thrown away without detriment to the
library.</p>

<p>P. 171. <i>Early Prices of Binding.</i>&mdash;The books or pamphlets issued
at one penny, that is, a silver penny of the day, were usually stitched
or sewn.</p>

<p>The edition of the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, 1552, was sold, bound
in parchment, at 3s. 4d., and in leather, paper boards, or clasps, at 4s.
But in the next impression, it being in contemplation to suppress
certain matter, the price was to be reduced in proportion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>[<a href="./images/339.png">339</a>]</span>
P. 183. There has been recently added to Cohen's work a companion
one on the French illustrated literature of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Books like Bewick's <i>Birds and Quadrupeds</i>, and indeed all works
of the modern side in request, are best liked in the original boards
with labels inviolate.</p>

<p>P. 191. <i>Cloister Life of Charles V.</i>&mdash;The Keir illustrated copy was
long at Leighton's in Brewer Street, while the late Sir W. Stirling-Maxwell
was known as Mr. Stirling.</p>

<p>P. 198. <i>Henry VIII., Prayers</i>, 1544.&mdash;This exists in later impressions
in English, and of the date 1544 in Latin.</p>

<p>P. 200. <i>Special Copies.</i>&mdash;To the list given may be added the extraordinary
volume of tracts formerly in the possession of Edmund
Spenser and Gabriel Harvey, a MS. note in which throws an entirely
new light on the earlier life of Spenser, as first pointed out by me
after my purchase of the book at an auction, where its importance
was overlooked.</p>

<p>P. 205. <i>Shakespear's Copy of Florio's Montaigne</i>, 1603.&mdash;In my
<i>Monograph on Shakespear</i>, 1903, I have adduced new evidence in
support of the authenticity of this and other signatures of the poet.</p>

<p>P. 206. <i>Books with MSS. Notes.</i>&mdash;There is yet another category of
remains among the older literature of all countries, and it is that, in
which an acknowledged judge or master of a subject, though himself
perhaps a person of no peculiar celebrity, has rendered a copy of some
book the medium for preserving for future use matter overlooked by
the author or editor or correcting serious errors, and the lapse of time
exercises its influence in the appreciation of such <i>adversaria</i>. A
living scholar may be capable of going far beyond his predecessors in
enriching margins and flyleaves; but there is the caveat that he is our
contemporary. The privilege of the grave appertains to the man who
laid down his pen ever so long ago. We may know much more than
Langbaine or Oldys about the drama, and than Johnson or Malone
about Shakespear; yet, depend upon it, their notes are more wanted
than ours.</p>

<p>P. 208. <i>Autographs in Books.</i>&mdash;In his copy of Slatyer's <i>Pal&aelig;albion</i>,
1621, the poet Earl of Westmorland wrote on a flyleaf: "Solus Deus
Protector Meus. W. Ex dono Danielis Beswitch servi mei fidelis, 1654."</p>

<p>Among his books Robespierre possessed a MS. Account of the
Glorious Achievements of Louis XIV. with illustrative drawings, and
did it the honour of attaching his autograph&mdash;an operation seldom so
harmless.</p>

<p>P. 218. <i>Books on Vellum.</i>&mdash;The <i>Hor&aelig;</i> of the Virgin in the ancient
impressions on vellum are commoner than those on paper, though, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>[<a href="./images/340.png">340</a>]</span>
the late Mr. Huth quietly observed to me, the vellum copies may be
more desirable.</p>

<p>The material, on which the Gwynn and Methuen copy of <i>Helyas</i>,
1512, was printed, was unusually coarse, and this criticism applies to
other early English books taken off on that substance. They are a
powerful contrast to the Italian productions of the same class.</p>

<p>P. 232. A good deal of information has gradually accumulated
respecting the Venetian school of binding; but undoubted examples
of early date remain singularly scarce. See my <i>Venetian Republic</i>,
1900, ii. 663, 728. The older school of French binding resembled that
of the finer porcelain of Chantilly and <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'S&eacute;vres'">S&egrave;vres</ins>, where on a choice piece
of the Louis XV. period are found, side by side, the separate marks
of maker, painter, and gilder.</p>

<p>P. 244-5. <i>English Binders.</i> Add:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Edmond Richardson of Scalding Alley.</li>
<li>Matthews. (Binder of the Hibbert, Wilkes, Gardner, and Huth copy of Shakespear, 1623.)</li>
<li>Hayday. (Worked for W. Pickering.)</li>
<li>Leighton.</li>
<li>J. &amp; J. Leighton. (This firm still does business in Brewer Street.)</li>
<li>Douglas Cockerell.</li>
<li>J. Larkins.</li>
<li>Miss Prideaux.</li>
<li>Sir Edward Sullivan.</li>
</ul>

<p>R. Montague (1730-40), bookseller, publisher, and binder, had a
place of business in 1732 at the corner of Great Queen Street, Drury
Lane, and in 1740 in Great Wyld Street. He undertook to gild and
letter books at his customers' own houses. John Bancks of Sunning
was his journeyman. It was the late Mr. Huth who expressed to me
the opinion that Bedford's brown calf should have been left to acquire
a natural tone.</p>

<p>P. 248. <i>Books with Painted and Goffered Edges.</i>&mdash;I have seen
volumes belonging to the first quarter of the sixteenth century with
the leaves goffered and ornamentally inscribed; but the painted
edge, as we know it, was then already in existence in Italy, and the
most eminent artists did not disdain to execute this kind of embellishment.
One family at Belluno long possessed numerous
examples enriched by the hand of Cesare Vecellio. See my <i>Venetian
Republic</i>, 1900, ii. 728. The major part of a sale at Sotheby's a year
or so ago consisted of books treated on this principle by the owner;
and the commercial result was not joyous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[<a href="./images/341.png">341</a>]</span>
P. 253. <i>French and other Binders.</i> Add:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Brodel <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ain&egrave;'">Ain&eacute;</ins> et fils.</li>
<li>Bisiques. (Famous for his Turkey leather.)</li>
<li>Thouvenin.</li>
<li>L. Muller. (Thouvenin's successor.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The house of Marius-Michel combined binding and gilding. Among
the Rothschild MSS., now in the British Museum, is a Boccaccio
bound by Thomas Berthelet before 1552 for the Protector Somerset.
It is in gilt calf with the motto: <i>Foy povr Debvoir</i>.</p>

<p>P. 263. The catalogue of the Early English Books in the British
Museum was mainly the work of Mr. Eccles, a late member of the
staff. A new, enlarged, and much improved edition by Mr. Pollard is
in progress.</p>

<p>P. 271. That fairly familiar term, <i>Unique</i>, has been very badly
entreated. A late eminent auctioneer, who was not shy of using
it, tried to bring into vogue the variant form, <i>Uni Que</i>.</p>

<p>P. 274. <i>Huth Catalogue.</i>&mdash;My copy is full of corrections, the text
abounding with errors, some of a very serious character. The late
Mr. F. S. Ellis was the responsible editor, and omitted at his discretion
much interesting matter.</p>

<p>P. 275. <i>Bibliographical Works of Reference.</i>&mdash;One of the best is
Dickson and Edmond's <i>Annals of Scotish Printing</i>, 1890. The
Rylands Catalogue proved a <i>fiasco</i>.</p>

<p>P. 298. Of course the notification in the press of a signally high
price at an auction for a really important lot overwhelms the vendors
with inquiries and offers&mdash;offers of similar treasures, which are
extremely the reverse.</p>

<p>P. 307. Mr. Robert Hoe acquired the bulk or whole of Mr. Pope's
books after his death, including the Caxton <i>Arthur</i>, 1485, and this
gentleman continues to buy some of the most important items which
occur for sale in London.</p>

<p>After all said, much as we at home here in Britain need to be better
instructed in the art of Book-Collecting, our American cousins are still
farther from having completed their education in this way&mdash;a few
have not commenced it, I fancy. It is not generally realised in
England that the American collector of loftier range is a type entirely
distinct from the normal book-collector, whose limit is quickly
reached. Those who buy books in the United States are by no means
all Hoes and Morgans.</p>

<p>P. 311. <i>Early Catalogues of old Plays.</i>&mdash;I should have added the
so often quoted one annexed to the <i>Old Law</i>, 1656.</p>

<p>P. 314. <i>Inch of Candle.</i>&mdash;This practice survived down to modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>[<a href="./images/342.png">342</a>]</span>
times both in France and England in the disposal or transfer of real
property.</p>

<p>P. 315. <i>Lazarus Seaman.</i>&mdash;This gentleman was a member of the
Assembly of Divines, and at one time chaplain to the Duke of
Northumberland. He held the living of All Hallows, Bread Street,
and became Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge. But he lost his clerical
preferment at the Restoration, and chiefly resided in his later days in
Warwick Lane, London, where he died in 1675.</p>

<p>P. 317. <i>Book Auctions.</i>&mdash;It is at present, I believe, at the discretion
of the auctioneer to postpone a sale, when the company is too small to
promise a satisfactory result, yet I have known one carried out when
not more than two influential bidders were present. In a catalogue
of 1681, however, there is a proviso that at least twenty gentlemen
must attend.</p>

<p>P. 323. It is a powerful exemplification of the contrast between old
times and ours, that Mr. Pierpont Morgan is credited with having
acquired forty Caxtons at one swoop.</p>
